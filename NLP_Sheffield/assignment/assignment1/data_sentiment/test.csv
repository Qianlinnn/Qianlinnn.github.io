"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal .  the setting of the film is a town named blue bay .  it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors .  the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school .  it is here that we meet all of the core characters .  there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan .  we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly .  throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape .  shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well .  this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted .  during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her .  however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor .  after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her .  it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together .  it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda .  matt dillon stars as sam lombardo .  sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage .  he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance .  however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place .  neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller .  suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film .  campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .  playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .  kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra .  one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .  denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .  in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well .  kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .  this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film .  however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .  still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name .  in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden .  hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .  although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters .  this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists .

"i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price .  as the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking .  jason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i . e .  the fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion .  this stunt , building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) .  he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross .  rosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross .  herman manages to destroy max's bike , while max cuts herman's brakes , and it goes on like this .  but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can't stand in the way of two people in love .  the academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn't an accident ) .  it maybe wasn't best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray's absense from the ballot is a complete snub .  the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it's fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic .  the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well .  i hope rushmore can overcome its' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers .

"what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is .  having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven .  that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie .  and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study .   "" carlito's way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality .  of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart .  carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not .  carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn .  when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive .  he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking .  carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding .  being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c .  and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) .  he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito .  on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison .  she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami .  while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) .  all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable .  when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it .  sure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate .  what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills .  like "" apollo 13 , "" we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle .  it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller .  de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films .  his earlier flim , "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over ) .  but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes .  to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet .  this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history .  with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) .  the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads .  pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn't as "" strong "" as his oscar-winning role in "" scent of a woman . ""  well , his "" scent of a woman "" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a "" foghorn leghorn impression . ""  in "" carlito's way , "" he's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change .  i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in "" scent of a woman . ""  as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry .  and they're scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship .  and sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney .  every scene he's in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino .  in smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great .   "" carlito's way "" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you're absolutely blown away .  it's a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn't do so hot .  but trust me and check it out .  it's a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right .

"uncompromising french director robert bresson's "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's "" morte darthur . ""  instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them .  chivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake , "" except as that of a dying ideal .  bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood .  bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure .  the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house .  since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films .  we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness .  but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film .  rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom .  lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh .  the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot .  even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment .  he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion .  when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense .  it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire .  bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds .   "" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music .  he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits .  the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest .  like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices .  all the actors he used in "" lancelot of the lake "" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again .  never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word .  instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images .  in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't .  the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment .  however , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable .  for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs .  he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag .  while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome .  nevertheless , "" lancelot of the lake "" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker .  bresson's style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist .  by re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns "" lancelot of the lake "" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film .

"aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads .  the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again .  when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson .  waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang .  as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence .  randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance .  the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within .  i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation .  kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one .  if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w .  griffith ( thematically speaking ) .  there is not a single likable character in the film .  the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) .  the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost .  even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects .  the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge .  what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society .  the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable .  damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful .  his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film .  david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) .  wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly .  sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage .  ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed .  note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism .  the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation .  there are no "" winners "" at the end of this film either .  no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began .  where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls .  it is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely .

"" shanghai noon "" is just good fun .  the chemistry between the cast is remarkable .  the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film .  jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before .  he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth .  but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on .  owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon .  his innocence is refreshing and fun .  a bad guy that's not really bad .  his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis .  lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant .  the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment .  the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances .  nothing here is realistic , mind you .   "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film .  and the performances match that style with ease .  the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous .  using calgary , alberta as the prime location .  mr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film .  nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre .  and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films .  homage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film .  it is a comforting experience .  at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing .  here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre .  this is the purest "" horse opera "" since the days of george o'brian or john wayne .  director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood's past .  in this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see .  nothing here really stands out , or takes one's attention away from the story or action .  and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star .  and what of the action and stunts .  well , while not up to a level of "" drunken master 2 "" or any of jackie's hong kong films , "" shanghai noon "" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before .  his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever .  jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) .  finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style .  to sum up , "" shanghai noon "" is a fun summer confection .  not too heavy and not too light .  a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) .  an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again .

"jacques tati's 1953 classic "" les vacances de m . hulot "" ( also known as "" mr . hulot's vacation , "" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film .  the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation .  yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory .  part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags .  slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going .  in "" les vacances de m . hulot , "" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key .  in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat .  while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it .  when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues .  tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film .  it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and "" les vacances de m . hulot "" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well .  tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement .  when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark .  tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , "" oh , he's not going to do that again , "" but , lo and behold , he does .  for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one .  then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce .  the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy .  as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did .  the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters .  it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons .  instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem .   "" les vacances de m . hulot "" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events .  anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store .  note : "" les vacances de m . hulot "" was not rated by the mpaa .  it would at most receive a pg rating .

"renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) .  the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts .  he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort . ""  the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage .  it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion .  what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring .  yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs .  also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors .  it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there .  it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness .  they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts .  she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) .  she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family .  simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays .  simon's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view .  screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts .  jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d .  in history , using for her thesis the study of 'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . '  she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control .  on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this .  to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister's new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he's so sensitive .  bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur .  he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him .  odile still pines for him , but he's married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly .  love is 'the same old song' that makes the world go 'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are .  everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be .  there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best .  this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting .  it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice .  it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love .

"a miracle of filmmaking , "" some like it hot "" is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists .  it is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilder's career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make .  jerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves .  one night , as they're playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided .  as it turns out , the owner , spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e . stone ) .  several weeks later , on valentine's day , jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage .  eager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid .  the only catch . . its a girls band .  so josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon ) , make their way onto the train and go to florida .  on the way there , they meet sugar kane ( monroe ) , a bombshell singer who is looking for love .  jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer , but there's two problems : 1 ) they're in drag , and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e . brown ) falls madly in love with daphne .  what follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the "" italian opera lovers festival "" .  tony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar .  marilyn monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity .  the scenes , however , are all stolen by either brown or lemmon .  lemmon is hysterical as daphne .  cast as the less rational one , lemmon's performance is ridiculously crazy , it is disorder in the style all billy wilder's .  brown is particularly hilarious as osgood , as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony .  he manages to use lemmon's ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire .  every set-piece is flawless , as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly , and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture .  wilder's script is stunning , as he carefully combines gangsters , cross-dressing , romance , sex , music , gender roles , and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness .  wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria , so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece , the final line of this absolutely incredible film .  wilder's is dead wrong when he says nobody's perfect : billy wilder is , especially when he makes something this disastrously funny .  nobody's perfect but billy wilder .

"in many ways , "" twotg "" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories .  there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold .  but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us "" the usual suspects "" .  his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry .  the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) .  these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough .  their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive .  given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter .  yet , they are incredibly foolish planners .  actually , these two never really have a plan .  they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked .  their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family .  if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on .  what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss .  moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her .  these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations .  they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high .  but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways .  the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation .  during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed .  because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome .  we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause .  as a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge .  the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur .  the momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money .  you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement .  in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it .  yet , for the most part , "" the way of the gun "" stays on target .  it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry .

"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release .  rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii .  the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days .  availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng .  the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small .  although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it .  to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past .  perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant .  in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end .  or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts .  having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it .  surprised ?  well , so was i .  drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu .  where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu .  apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better .  one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those .  the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace "" .  the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill .  however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs .  the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners .  in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer .  in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng .  after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng .  and so it goes .  and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves .  let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the  action .  there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of  course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected .  however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius .  the primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk .  further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but  there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor .  under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair .  the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching .  another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work .  even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film .  among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) .   ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . )  unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked .  drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( "" a better tomorrow "" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the "" heroic trio "" series , "" rumble in the bronx "" ) .  the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film .  the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong ) .  jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii .  as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film .  it's nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s .  the picture is crisp and clear .  one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i've ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below .   ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . )  it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release .  drunken master ii shows the full potential of "" period piece "" kung fu movies , and it's good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies .  the plot does meander a bit , but that's to be expected in this type of film .  if you like this kind of movie , you'll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway .  if nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental .

"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .  sometimes the stories are compelling .  sometimes they're not .  but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .  star trek : insurrection is no exception .  the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .  it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .  some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .  others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .  i simply enjoyed the film .  insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .  of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .  murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .  the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .  that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .  so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .  when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .  this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .  insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .  stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .  jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .  if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .  i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .  better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .  with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .

"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation .  on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice .  on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events .  this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow .  indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled .  _beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war .  for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil .  oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end .  what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished .  _beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin .  the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse .  invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards .  sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves .  demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects .  all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real .  when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror .  instead , he asks who the ghost is .  as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created .  sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears .  in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay .  the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump .  sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health .  they know not who she is , but that doesn't matter .  only paul d is suspicious of the stranger .  little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years .  winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset .  she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show .  lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later .  danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter .  as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears .  the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself .  thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end .  departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel .  totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit .  _beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do .  for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality .  this , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book .  though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film .  nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer .  morrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb .  the movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle .  taken as a

"you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade .  two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities .  nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence .  ephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple .  ryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble ) .  their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots .  for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn .  yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan .  and the two are kept busy .  one , the other or both are in nearly every scene .  hanks has his decent guy routine down pat , yet each time he does it , it seems effortless , spontaneous and fresh .  ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable , with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew .  their scenes together sparkle , even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle .  and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe .  the sparks created by the earlier movie are , by necessity , not evident here .  true , these are two people seeking true love , but you've got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor .  the ephrons' script is witty and sharp .  however , as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven .  some scenes drag , while others , especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail , are crisp and tidy .  also , the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story .  a nice , romantic soundtrack adds to this date-night special .  overall , you've got mail is a lush and cute outing , taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads .  it's a nice holiday movie , one for holding hands and snuggling .  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  ",1
"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions .  the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike .   ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . )  the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe .  denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host .  in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) .   ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word . )  unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans .  one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate .  others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of .  my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams .  arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do .  her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well .   "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession .  she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar .   "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us .  her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith .  along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty .  and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment .  few other avocations could give this much satisfaction .  these people are having the time of their lives .   ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . )  the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans .  the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong .  filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions .  at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel .  after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left .  they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus . ""  the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too .  with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity .  not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies .  one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist .  the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set .  he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time .  it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family .  for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time .  he says his patients like it .  well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway .  there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language .  hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible .  they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs .  the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns .  sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work .  the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator .  he fits right in .  trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 .  it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .

"while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general .  words "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations .  the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context .  in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise .  same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime .  the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe .  his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro .  shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away .  after being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) .  upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba .  shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war .  thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary .  it shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books .  those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre .  this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires .  unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work .  the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda .  christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role .  his performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate .  his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the "" normal "" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends .  although the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character .  however , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague .  this was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director .  with the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess .  luckily , the dogs of war had a good script .  irvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel .  the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places .  in the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes .  unfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help .  but , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama .

"this "" dumb "" cowboy blondie who thinks he is a `darn' good loverboy , decides to leave his dusty ol' town somewhere in texas and go to new york .  he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach .  when he arrives to new york , he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best `darn' `stud' in the whol'o' new york city .  obviously he fails .  he meets the 'cripple' rico ( dustin hoffman , who is terrifically good ) in a bar .  rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down , so he walks in a peculiar way .  rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this 'rich' dumb cowboy .  he cheats our cowboy out of $20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears .  soon , our cowboy runs out of money : he gets kicked out of his hotel , and starts getting hungry .  walking through the city , with "" everybody's talkin' "" playing in the background ( oh , and his prided techno transistor radio in hand ) , he spots rico in a cafe .  rico , half-scared , pours out all the money in his pocket .  60 filthy cents .  our cowboy , hungry , is forgiving .  he is glad he found someone he knows .  rico offers to make it up for him .  and he invites him to his place .  and what a filthy , cold place it is .  our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the ( junk ) bed .  when he finally wakes ( jumps ? )  up , he finds rico looking at him .   "" you wanna cup'a'coffee ? ""  rico asks in his friendly , sleazy , somewhat-childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy .   "" what're you ?  a goddamn faggot ?  what do you want from me ?  where are my shoes ?  what did you do to them ? ""  but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded .  rico really has a heart .  together , they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death .  rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida , where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees .  but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida .   "" we will soon be in miami "" is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking , moving end of a film it is .  the classic theme music : "" midnight cowboy "" helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film .  whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams , is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable .

" "" six days , seven nights "" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare .  here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff .  of course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be .  as his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance .  the age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by .  the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe .  robin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there .  the plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization .  a series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other .  meanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) .  that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin .  and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience .  director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk .  at a slim 101 minutes , "" six days , seven nights "" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title .  michael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is "" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? "" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they're all quite engaging .  even the movie's more "" serious "" moments are played with a wink .  heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the "" believability "" of "" six days , seven nights "" ' heterosexual pairing .   ( so she's a lesbian .  so what .  deal with it . )  of course it doesn't , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way .  in fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity .  at one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is .  after several wrong guesses ( "" forty-five ?  _fifty_ ? "" ) , he whispers his age to her .   "" you still look good , "" heche stammers .   "" i still _am_ good , "" ford replies .  she's good too , and together , they make "" six days , seven nights "" one memorable ride .  ",1
"the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible .  people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred .  five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation .  the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry .  as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe .  in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution . ""  each of the five tells his or her story .  their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary .  they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps .  they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope .  each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation .  and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps .  needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining .  by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five .  the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage .  in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration .  the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days .  it's not clear which scene it is .  it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful .  one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars .  there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white .  another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore .  there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say .  but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail .  and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject .  the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful .  x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green .  also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) ,  so the richness and detail are impeccable .  the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen .  there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter .  there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors .  also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side .  one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) .  you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers .  instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length .  one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film .  renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz .  firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought .  the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable .  another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz .  he ends his prayer by saying "" . . . forgive me for surviving . ""  it's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film .  it's ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies .  it's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers .  but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well .  it's only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful .

"it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste .  indeed .  while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration .  i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps-and despite the final shot's ambiguity , i left completely satisfied .  henry fool ( "" used to have an ? e' "" ) arrives at garbageman simon grim's house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henry ( martin donovan look-alike ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who has been "" exiled and marginalized "" by the publishing community because of his criminal activity .  simon's poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high-school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its "" pornographic "" content .  meanwhile , henry seduces both simon's dependent mother ( porter ) and immature sister ( sundance queen posey ) with philosophical babble ( which is by turns brilliant and inane ) and breathy animal lust .  these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher-student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself .  henry fool is sprinkled with hartley-ian flourishes : simon drinks milk from "" udderley's "" ; the big teen hang-out is called "" world of donuts "" ; simon wears his garbageman's uniform throughout ; the editing style is decidedly elliptical . . .   ( which is key to the conclusion's said ambiguity ) .  the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously "" quirky "" ; the introductory scenes are a chore .  these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren't pop slackers .  the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of .   ( shades of film school . . . )  the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one's patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length .  how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character .  and unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded .  this , hartley's seventh feature , is contemplative about "" the artist "" ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon's work , and it's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers' pens .

" "" the end of the affair "" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs .  although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience .  based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters .  there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) .  sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy .  it's all work and no play with him .  while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her .  unfortunately the two break up .  this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present .  it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too .  while this may sound straight forward it's not .  it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love .  all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest .  with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why .  the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan .  even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive .  what's so moving about it you ask ?  the tragedy of it all .  it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing .  it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect .  everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces .  back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses .  there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are .  it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start .  it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things .  also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan .  i'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par .  it just never did anything for me , until now .  when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless .  this is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore .  not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value .

"magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft .  at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film .  it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions .  it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking .  it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers .  director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax .  the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives .  there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose "" search and destroy "" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants .  there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son .  there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public .  and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process .  given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) .  a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) .  hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair .  it is not a pleasant movie .  there is not one bad note in the acting .  it is affecting and layered and wonderful .  there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films .  then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene .  walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing .  robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks .  director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote .  the problem is that he stays on them too long .  julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it .  after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture .  quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around .  and just what is the theme ?  alienation ?  hopelessness ?  anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy .  the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events .  it's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come .  at times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time .  other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening .  anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film !  what's surprising is that it mostly works .  if you have doubts about anderson's intentions , i'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame .  despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption .  despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts .  this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling .  my rating : a bulleye .   ( stars )  a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann .  her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful .  when she sings "" save me "" at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as "" wise up "" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives .

" * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *  the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them .  the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film .  james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film .  and i liked each film separately for which it was .  now alien 3 is out .  and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were .  unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens .  this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off .  the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens .  the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg .  in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel .  this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .  everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley .  the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .  fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .  when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .  all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years .  ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .  as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet .  being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .  so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .  i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here .  the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story .  she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor .  yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .  it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well .  a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .  there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .  in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .  it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !  i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .  sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .  her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .  the rest of the cast is also quite good .  notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .  alien 3 has a very distinct look .  this is due largely to its director , david fincher .  mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here .  his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before .  for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .  the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .  elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in .  this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .  this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .  this is a great score .  the ending to alien 3 is quite good .  there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .  i will not ruin the ending for you .  go see the film .  i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .  alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .  and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in .

" "" gattaca "" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it's a genre picture that doesn't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story .  the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction .  this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they'd like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects .  those made the old-fashioned way are labeled as "" in-valids "" and confined to the lower rung of society .  vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton .  fed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation .  everyday , he watches as "" superior "" folk make his fantasy a reality .  determined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids .  his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life .  for a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card .  because of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she's enamored by his flawless persona she doesn't know is a lie .  but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered .  two ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate's loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent's eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent's cover and derail his goal .  even if "" gattaca "" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film's look is dazzling without ever being flashy .  first-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama "" the truman show "" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance .  an opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily .  niccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way .  when it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless .  ethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level .  his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting's clinical chill .  as the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it's his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core .  in "" gattaca "" 's series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful .  things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view .  the big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed .  still , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it's successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it's a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it's a futuristic fable without blood and guts .  even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage .  although it's portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , "" gattaca "" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film .

"i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of "" good will hunting "" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight .  the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight .  professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions .  this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but "" good will hunting "" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama .  a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting .  will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle .  he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her .  what makes "" good will hunting "" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life .  the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong .  lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say .  and sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will .  will's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious "" right "" and "" wrong "" side and beating them over the head with it .  for a film with such an extraordinary character , "" good will hunting "" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another .  this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation .   "" good will hunting "" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture .  and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa .  will's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character .  add all this to the fact that "" good will hunting "" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars .  well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original .  there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions .  still , "" good will hunting "" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of '97 films .

"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent .  people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee .  the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves .  the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta .  shanta has a small circle of male admirers .  two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim .  the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das .   ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . )  in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears .  one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along .  he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism .  the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses .  it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter .  the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together .  but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state .  a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees .  another man is murdered .  the group of friends will not meet again .  the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles .  it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully .  the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz .  his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim .  dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him .  but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer .  the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate .  despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things .  the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt .  the story earth tells does not end .  it just stops .  it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction .  but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades .  since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus .  there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) .  earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie .  it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas .  but deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep .  earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history .  such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed .  they may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack .  it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve .  the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year .  in the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other .  at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding .

"so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton , but they just don't get the good grades .  so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools .  legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide , the remaining roommates will get an automatic 4 . 0 .  chris ( michael vartan ) and tim ( matthew lillard ) are two guys who really want the 4 . 0 to get into harvard .  how far will they go to get their 4 . 0 ?  chris and tim are also roommates with rand , played by randall batinkoff .  the two scheme to murder rand , make it look like a suicide , so they can supposedly get their 4 . 0 .  they have heard this rumor many places , and they are willing to take the chance to find out .  rand is a very , very mean person .  he treats his girlfriend natalie , played by tamara craig thomas , like she doesn't matter at all .  she is very afraid of him , and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant .  she does tell him , and he becomes enraged .  that night would be the last night of rand's life .  tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison , making him think that it is beer .  rand drinks down the poison , and then dies .  now , tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself .  it does not take long until the suicide note is found , but the body isn't found .  the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information .  feeling extreme guilt , chris is having a very hard time , especially with his girlfriend , emma , played by keri russell .  she wants to know more , but he will not even speak with her .  will he give in ?  will tim turn chris in ?  will chris turn tim in ?  will they turn themselves in ?  all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film .  the events in the curve are very surprising , original , and fun .  the plot sounds much like dead man on campus , but that is not the deal with this film .  this film is a very serious one , with not many laughs .  there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films .  the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying .  it is a terrific , suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen .  hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride .  the sound really stood out in the film .  it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film .  the way the movie is filmed is also great .  all of the technical aspects , as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done .  the performances in the curve are very good .  matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role , just like in 1996's scream .   ( a+ ) he is very strange in this film as well .  i like him in this sort of role , rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she's all that .  michael vartan is fantastic as chris , who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the 4 . 0 .  michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed , where he co-starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student .  keri russell also gives a great performance .  she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film .  tamara craig thomas is also realistic , especially coping with the death of her boyfriend .  some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles , such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case .  the bottom line- i might just have to curve that a- into an a .   * note- the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998 .  it was decided the film would not be released widely .  it is now available at blockbuster video only , and for rent only .  see you at the video store !

"krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy .  done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema .  however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works .  professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble .  his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea .  however , he found . . . nothing .  his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) .  tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe .  rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) .  however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon .  soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members .  his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) .  krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief .  no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes .  luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by .  though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies .  the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb .  richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe .  jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability .  even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous .  yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny .  it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs .

"roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton .  this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust .  but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice .  the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore .  like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence .  he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government .  instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official .  in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter .  guido wins dora .  they marry .  fast forward about five years .  guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family .  guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore .  but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities .  the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp .  here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated .  it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched .  for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list .  true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor .  unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust .  his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child .  for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game .  giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points .  the winner takes home a tank .  therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks .  he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him .  guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates .  guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive .  throughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way .  ultimately , the allies rescue the camp .  in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound .  the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game .  the price for his victory is most high .  benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness .  life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable .  it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust .  those who object to it are missing its point .  and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished .  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  ",1
"for a movie about disco-era excess , "" 54 "" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club .  think of it as a sort of "" boogie nights "" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , "" 54 "" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination .  it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either .  in fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , "" 54 "" would be about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle .  studio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 .  inside , anything went and , we are told , everything did .  the film's fictional main character is shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines .  his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in '79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course .  once inside , shane becomes seduced by the club's dizzying vortex of sex and drugs .  he has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy .  he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own .  after rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 .  but fame doesn't come without a price .   "" 54 "" 's major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act .  alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since "" 54 "" sometimes feels like it's missing a scene here or there .  nowhere is this more apparent than in shane's relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he's long admired from afar .  the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special .  that "" 54 "" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it's assembled .  sure , it's shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we've seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision .  the film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( "" the wedding singer "" 's ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54's closed doors and asks for a "" funky little treat . ""  the solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you're caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot .  newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it's a shame their subplot goes nowhere .  meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in "" clueless "" ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , "" one , two , three , attitude ! ""  sherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big '70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left "" er "" as rubell's accountant , but she's criminally underused .  as the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone .  when he's not playing the life of the party , the ex- "" saturday night live "" comedian strips away all of rubell's confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it's a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees .  and while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate "" austin powers "" -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with "" 54 "" 's overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball .

"star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review  a review by jamey hughton stars )  starring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g  with all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film .  the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together .  can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ?  yes . this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity .  but that doesn't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment .  the phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history .  the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film .  the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding .  the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects .  after we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan' .  they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo .  oh , but enough about that .  the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture .  as you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader .  a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter .  this particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you'll ever see .  one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception .  i loved sebulba , the rat-like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) .  one character who has been subject to criticism is jar-jar binks , a member of the gungan race .  jar-jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief .  yes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics .  there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses .  the final light-saber battle , between the jedi's and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold .  jabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances .  lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness .  one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode's i and ii .  when they arrive , you'll know where to find me .

" "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline .  watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter .  everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally .  but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on .  exactly what was i looking at ?  watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous .  directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses .  everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing .  the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close .  the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche .  as such , there is no real story .  i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like .  he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty .  as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero .  he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him .  it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) .   "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life .  bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor .  he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) .  bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning .  george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason .  the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another .  while creating bacon's world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant .  bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings .  while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there .  the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about .  once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together .  i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was .  someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in .  thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother .  i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain .  he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george .  i guess that explains the title .  a bit .  that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning .  i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) .  or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche .  it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat .  that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not .  i can't say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil , "" though .  despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through .  even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour .  though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it .  as such , i respect the way the film looks .  it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with "" what dreams may come "" and "" dark city , "" it's the year's most visually stunning film .  in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever .  and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs .  i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance .  then i would have had something to hold me over even now .

"my summer was recently saved by two very different movies .  on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron .  then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott .  however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) .  after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield .  the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges .  at first , briggs doesn't want to be there .  he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone .  however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature .  the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift .  briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers .  after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished .  and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds .  greenfingers , which is "" inspired by actual events , "" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that .  despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show .  one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent .  of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not "" prison love "" ) .  to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace .  i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers .  the movie deals with people and scores on that concept .  it's wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again .  give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting .  his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman's last stand in the shawshank redemption .  owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy .  written by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs .  most come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs .  the mother can't believe what he'll do if her daughter "" burns the sunday roast . ""  nothing is forced in greenfingers .  the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines .  primrose and briggs' relationship takes awkward steps .  even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it's done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so .  after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america's sweethearts and the princess dairies , it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well .

"some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen .  i finished mike figgis' "" leaving las vegas "" hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr .  alot of people refer to this film as "" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude "" .   "" leaving las vegas "" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore .  ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk .  his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor .  in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a "" friend "" of his to mooch some money off of .  he finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid .  when ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable .  after lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says "" i think it would be best if you didn't contact me again . ""  now even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben .  there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye .  it turns out that ben was once a semi-successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy .  now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with .  once he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death .  one night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since "" adventures in babysitting "" ) named sera .  she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cutting her .  they are both very lonely , self-destructive people .  they immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another .  and it isn't even a sexual relationship .  they don't even have sex until , like , the last ten minutes of the film .   "" leaving las vegas "" is not a film about plot .  with the exception of what i have already revealed ( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so , by the way ) , there isn't too much of a story to it .  it is more a film about people and how they react to one another .  from what i can see , this is basically a perfect film .  the direction is great ( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody , smokey atmosphere of a film noir ) and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s , or any other decade for that matter .  but don't go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you're getting yourself into .  first off , if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge , stay away from "" leaving las vegas "" .  it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms , rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon ( that's right ) .  secondly , if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film , don't see it .  however , if you are cool with those two things , you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have .

"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .  cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .  technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .  lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men .  three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery .  a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .  opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .  in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .  real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved .  spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .  djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .

"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes .  saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first .   "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness .  hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer .  the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen .  then comes the setup .  donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients .  to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines .  gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . ""  the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash .  there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead .  the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money .  since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers .  decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby .  she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life .  thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature .  owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america .  an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game .  after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention .  mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america .  he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times .  pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation .  randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas .  fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview .  beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert .  brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid .  blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him .  the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal .  finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey .  at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman .  director jerry zucker ( "" airplane , "" "" ghost "" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers .  as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps .  high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off .  had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron .  it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation .  i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence .  my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing "" all star ? ""  but enough carping .   "" rat race "" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast .  see it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for .

"i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan .  i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work .  breakdown , then , is something of a surprise .  russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film .  to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm .  russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life .  while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t .  walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck .  because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help .  that , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her .  breakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films .  as with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller .  jeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on .  when we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little .  russell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 .  j . t .  walsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here .  the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable .  breakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats .  one of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low .  oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film .  it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s .  things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) .  she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) .  the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown .  meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars .  only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses .  although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film .  while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black .  in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions .  the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era .  the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro .  of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year .  tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ?  sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter .  these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation .  this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal .  this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching .  mr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him .  much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career .  as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range .  i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks !  and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . )  of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry .  while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better .  and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment .  with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next .

"it must be tough to be a mob boss .  just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing .  i can believe it , too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with .  suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help .  and who better than billy crystal .  after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here .  playing vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish .  casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think .  placed in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino .  it's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so .  the man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day .  ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors .  the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) .  playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped .  the supporting cast sparkles .  joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti's pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure' .  the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides .  the situation is just too cute to resist .  it's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand .  but hey , if you're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally .  and near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat .

"the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen .  in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven .  his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of .  that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage .  the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . .  with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator .  luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie .  talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career .  his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona .  he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey .  he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however .  ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show .  quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer .  unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all !  also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia .  she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her .  the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy .  the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film .  peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun .  the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card .  although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll .  sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam .  also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing .  the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim .  while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do .  also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show .  overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment .  certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone .  it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998   "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes  ",1
"the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy .  but after diasappointing films such as "" godzilla "" and "" fear and loathing in las vegas "" , it would be nice to see a really good film .  but i doubt you could have expected this .  the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the "" decade's best "" list .  there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , "" yes , that's what makes this film great . ""  the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically .  there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show .  it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect .  carrey has made a very wise choice .  by playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side .  that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes .  truman burbank was born to an audience of millions .  he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show .  everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show's director , christof ( played by ed harris ) .  everyone in truman's life is an actor or an extra .  they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman's life .  but he is the only person that is not aware of it .  the classification of the truman show may be tricky .  the audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter .  i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character .  the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong .  so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ?  a drama ?  it really depends on the audience .  but to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others .  but above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism .  oscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar-less .

"i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there's something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year .  from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 .  it is that good of a film .  when gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous .  how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ?  but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about .  once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer .  and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special .  now for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding ) .  the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) .  forget "" blazing saddles "" , "" animal house "" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , "" monty python's meaning of life "" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses .  in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is "" monty python and the holy grail "" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade .  but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of "" mary "" ; it has a huge heart .  you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers .  they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) .  they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses .  it's funny , though .  if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable .  but believe me , it is anything but .  ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) .  after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w .  early brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from "" scream "" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom .  in one of the film's funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won't ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again .  jump to the present .  after years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school .  healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself .  admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired .  after all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ?  somehow , the farrelly's pull it off .  the performances here are also right on target .  as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable .  and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary's brother .  no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here .  i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february .  as good as the actors are , though , it's the directors' movie all the way .  i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg's wwii epic "" saving private ryan "" .  and yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting .  but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for minutes at a time ?  i'll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns .  there is just something about "" mary "" .

"the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features .  although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers .  set in modern-day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) .  as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet .  earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child .  when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children .  nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) .  bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with .  leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing .  there are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration .  almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman .  maybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence .  leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances .  one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply .  it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible .  although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another .  ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her .  these "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman .  left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer .  refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below .  despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him .  sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ?  in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair .  unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words .  every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else .  for all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn't a perfect film .  on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed .  and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before .  mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi .  despite these minor missteps , "" leila "" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la .  the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return .  it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .

"as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ?  also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films .  this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school .  intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei .  meanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail .  in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings .  in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls .  neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival .  suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them .  an opening prologue in shall we dance ?  goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety .  it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle .  the dance school in shall we dance ?  plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities .  most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba .  sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps .  it's a delicate performance with a huge heart .  shall we dance ?  is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit .  suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution .  it is here that shall we dance ?  feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis .  suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together .  that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ?  conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt .

"i can sum up first strike in one word : awesome .  never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan .  for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever appeared in , he should be awarded greatly .  the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan's rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well .  however , first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three , for the simple reason that practice makes perfect .  his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great .  like rumble , this film is about the mafia , the former kgb .  now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men .  the trailer for the film sums it up quite well .  first strike is action-packed , but the fight scenes are so fast and furious , they almost have a witty , italian-like humor to them .  jackie chan is a regular comedian .  well , he's no eddie murphy , but he can really crack you up .  for example , he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him , as he claims to be the korean 007 ( that's secret agent james bond ) .  even the plot to this film improved above the others , as a sort-of twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame .  but never fear , as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident .  with some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy , first strike is a sure-fire hit that's guaranteed to draw some major , world-wide attention .   ,  ",1
"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies .  consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste .  top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety .  based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel .  told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator .  the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes .  in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children . ""  he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children .  picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges .  periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over .  you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment .  they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured .  and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again .  although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss .  ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery .  mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness .  his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf .  if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot .  the story unfolds slowly and always believably .  each little aspect has its own fascination .  as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task .  he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit .  wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults .  although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles .  one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids .  well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita .  his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story .  the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film .  although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy .  as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning .  to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear .  his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another .  fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk .   ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy .   "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back .  mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . )  mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy .  the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best .  the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience .  still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did .  i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed .  more than anything , the film is like a master painting .  each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint .  with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll .  the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 .  it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers .

" "" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made .  it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout .  this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly .  harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife .  the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner .  we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective .  hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered .  we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story .  in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves .  the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story .  one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck .  but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch .  this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable .  tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives .  from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur .  kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other .  most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife .  ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is .  just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting .  we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we .  meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down .  at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them .  he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery .  one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor .  there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) .  they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner .  the final act concludes with another terrific chase .  richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved .  the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together .  maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it .  we're so relieved when justice is served .  it's not the plot is that makes "" the fugitive "" great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story .  watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous .  if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .

"for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative .  written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement .  slow is the best description for the film at first .  it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family .  father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities .  they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder .  you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome .  but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident .  the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span .  though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving .  though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece .  one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable .  what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction .  the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss .  you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing .  you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation .  even better are the role reversals that take place within the household .  while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot .  not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them .  these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change .  respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture .  self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family .  though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives .  most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing .  in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters .  it's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .

"confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind .  i don't know why , really .  haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen .  so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes . . .  is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ?  maybe that's going a little bit too far .  as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh .  but . . .  the parallels are there .  gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor .  titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors .  gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy .  they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . .  ok , maybe that's not enough parallels .  so titanic's not in gwtw's league .  no matter .  titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills .  much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again .  the money was obviously well-spent .  the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great .  i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks .  but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects .  cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in .  he succeeds masterfully .  cameron does two things that work incredibly well .  first , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just "" titanic "" , not "" the titanic "" , mind you ) .  the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) .  television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 .  stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew .  secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) .  the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people .  cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board .  the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in .   ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . )  the love story itself is rather conventional .  i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism .  the performances are the key here .  zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt .  he's smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he's a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible .  at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not "" can i save this little girl ? "" ,  but "" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? ""  dicaprio is a revelation .  i hadn't seen him before in anything , and didn't know what the heck to expect , really .   ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . )  dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it's hard not to like him .  from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters .  winslet's character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance .  at first , she's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous .  we know from the narration that she's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn't any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio .  winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg .  it's at that moment where winslet's character really comes alive .  faced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job .  as rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal's fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror .  of course , the most interesting character is the ship itself .  cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain's table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead .  cameron's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well .

"along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view .  for all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart .  the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role .  accepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood .  it was , definitely , an enormous risk but i'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face .  braveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film .  for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest .  the william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries .  seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland .  as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up .  his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward's son .  however , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought .  braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays .  mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast .  patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank .  the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good .  sophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart .  i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace .  however , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor .  the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is .  when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film .  braveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 !  i've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean .  for now , let's see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia .  it won't be easy !  it's gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson .

"tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way .  if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points .  when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : "" literary . ""  what's eating gilbert grape ?  is such a film .  it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence .  gilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities .  as the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store .  he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) .  gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down .  as he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing .  slowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people .  director lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel .  endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else .  the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real .  minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife .  one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band .  not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false .  the same can be said of the character of gilbert .  it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once . ""  gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty .  in one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction .  his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie's repeated chants of , "" we're not going anywhere , "" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard .  johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands .  depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie .  he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real .  dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw .  darlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert's tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert's sisters .  only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark .  gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me .  thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait .

"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex .  it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year ) .  in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman .  they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other .  he is an m . d . , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party .  at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else .  when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night .  he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with .  they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer .  she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night .  bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient .  this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town .  the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down .  he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street .  then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other .  erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the "" action "" until he is discovered to be an outsider .  much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene .  with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating .  european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it .  roger ebert calls the american version the "" austin powers version , "" and many others have bashed the alterations .  i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere .  the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks .  this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery .  from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at .  to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still .  at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity .  it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic .  it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship .  at the end , it seems , bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york .  kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman .  tom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take .  nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod .  the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford's mysterious friend .  eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander .  still , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick's best it is a worthy final film , a complex

"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america .  o . j .  simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers .  all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms .  and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood .  whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks .  so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat .  however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one .  john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it .  no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever .  but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting .  a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 .  travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations .  his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid .  if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average .  luckily , he has a strong supporting cast .  william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood .  he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor .  in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant .  he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film .  he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant .  but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action .  robert duvall is also an underrated actor .  he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey .  duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant .  duvall is magical in this role .  he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way .  in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes .  unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) .  however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed .  this is not the case in a civil action .  they have comedy coming from all sides .  whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace .  granted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film .  the plot is terrific- somewhat .  the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom .  then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head .  they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it .  however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt .  i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film .  the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored .  it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific .  all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film .  his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta .  the film is smart , witty and thought provoking .  not only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players .  a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .

"one of the best movies i've ever seen .  i'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now .  for some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u . s . it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records .  after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ?  the strength of this film is it's gritty realism .  the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes .  you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real .  i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken .  even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase .  and the ending . . . . . . whoa .  i've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly .  the three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific .  the 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there .  how could they have chosen between these three actors ?  there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two .  it's impossible .  kim bassinger's performance is also a revelation .  i'd never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was , well . . . what's the word - a twinky ?  that impression has changed , as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly .  the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding .  no cardboard characters here .  the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences .  pearce's interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant .  i really can't fault this movie at all .  i was so glad to see fellow australian's pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie .  i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films , but had not seen much of guy pearce .  i intend to change this next time i visit the video store : )  ",1
"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living .  he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings .  on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks .  fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt .  for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives .  they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle .  alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility .  the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident .  the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it .  however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through .  he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger .  and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money .  however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money .  he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents .  he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner .  his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years .  she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for .   "" i don't know who i'm taking to , "" he tells her .  in his mind , his daughter is dead .  the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own .  however , not everyone in town wants it to happen .  billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it .  he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman .  he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds .  to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way .  central to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it .  aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out .  it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled .  obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck .  her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) .  there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film .  of all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film .  egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up .  what egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous .  in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life .  egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold .   "" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy .   "" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked .  the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind .  the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements .  like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole .  he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease .  the actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight .  because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms .  certainly one of the best films of 1997 , "" the sweet hereafter "" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film .

"capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers .  wilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis .  what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ?  how much did he know about crimes against humanity ?  the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation .   , high +2 ( -4 to +4 )  in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists .  szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope .  it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them .  ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich .  maj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor .  when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen .  after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes .  he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty .  from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra .  as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation .  there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting .  perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed .  if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth .  in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler .  where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous .  it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act .  when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation .  perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is .  we are given clues to something but they are never tied up .  in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler .  the film is basically a stage play .  the visual is not very important .  corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location .  as with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing .  i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  [there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice .  at one point we clearly see arnold's desk calendar say "" jan 16 tues . ""  a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 .  the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 .  a possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ]  ",1
"catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up .  she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life .  as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties .  a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls .  just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia .  the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state .  in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . .  a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours !  initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix .  while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm .  the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . 's "" losing my religion "" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory .  despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery .  all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe .  the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room .  if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) .  the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) .  in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . -  the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him .  the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him .  detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both .  besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling .  a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting .  one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device .  as a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking .  as a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done .  although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together .  unfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) .

"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop .  okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart .  most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them .  however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered .  a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash .  but , the thing is , it isn't .  it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent .  i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film .  but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements .  it's about how much it can get into one film .  and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so .  species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe .  many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs .  species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars .  aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut .  patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed .  well , it would seem that he has succeeded .  landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so .  of course , he isn't the first ever .  about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life .  now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky .  no life lives on it .  that is , no visible life .  patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground .  he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage .  unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship .  just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings .  they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember .  they blame it on a technical malfunction .  back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible .  as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet .  however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is .  patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) .  eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien .  however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant .  the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable .  since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again .  and it has .  story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story ) .  what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay .  in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles .  this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) .  the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot .  beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie .  and it does it quite well .  the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do .  the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does .  there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects .  the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad .  but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) .  also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off .  however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary .  many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence .  however , i tend to disagree .  what were the alien films about ?  and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ?  my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store .  i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) .  the acting is quite good for this kind of film .  it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least .  the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens .  okay , so it isn't that good .  george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting .  natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage .  however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent .  oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch .  marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film .  michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) .  james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor .  as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability .  mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel .  and , of course , justin lazard .  lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective .  sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ?  the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting .  species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language .  this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see .  more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives .  hell , i don't even know if i will .  what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year .  i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while .  director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series .  medak has also mastered the wonderful "" jump ! ""  moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) .  strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining .

"'lake placid' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever .  actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film .  well the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror/comedies they are .  i will admit that 'lake placid' isn't an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny .  bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half .  she gets there but really doesn't understand why she is there .  bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on .  what they find though isn't great .  a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why .  they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from .  betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you'll have to see the movie to find out .  her character is very funny and foul-mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny .  to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws .  with the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is .  when you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it .  david e . kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job .  the characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one-liners .  but believe me , don't take 'lake placid' too seriously or you won't like it .  but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun 'popcorn' type movie .  but i guess it rates above the 'popcorn' rating .  sit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want .  even though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore .  there's really not that much gore , but what there is might seem kinda gross to some .  'lake placid' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too .  ",1
"eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career .  known for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years .  with the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback .  life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel .  director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up .  life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other .  amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other .  as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club .  there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) .  somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run .  when all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff .  hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan .  the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude .  luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner .  not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too .  murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards .  this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve .  while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core .  but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars .  the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight .  i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to .  it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll .

"kadosh means sacred in hebrew .  amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one .  the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government .  gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel .  the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view .  that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are .  the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel .  this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief .  it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go .  the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance .  the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace .  the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god .  he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman .  his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom .  she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv .  meir is a talmudic scholar .  his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva .  he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child .  since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage .  she receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead . ""  meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud .  meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : "" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . ""  all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren .  she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel .  their religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor .  rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion .  so when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters .  rivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life .  she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov .  but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin .  when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer .  he now works as a singer in a nightclub .  malka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love .  yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies .  the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage .  the harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night .  yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love .  the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does .  but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up .  for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones .  gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life .  the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .

"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn' .  followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer .  then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see .  well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here .  'here' , of course , was still three months away .  i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow .  i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list .  that , let me tell you , has changed completely .  i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet .  the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick .  seriously .  i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry ,  make that 'roles' in the movie .  even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals .  my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout .  half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - "" doesn't it just break your heart . "" he mutters coldly .  now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not .  that's what really makes this movie unique .  it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all .  suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's  the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and  never hit .  several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again .  the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant .  whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing .  joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife .  i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it  would have wrecked her potrayal .  gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends .  other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a  sex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent .  dominique swain , who plays archer's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen's or gershon's .  faults ? well . . . there were some i have to say .  first , the movie's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it's own good .  after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - "" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? "" .  there were certain bits that weren't handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice .  overall , this movie was not perfect .  but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect .  many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i  certainly hope so .

"susan granger's review of "" big eden "" ( jour de fete )  it's utopia , this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin , louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people , regardless of sexual preference .  there's nary a homophobe or bigot around , much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) , a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam ( george coe ) , the ailing grandfather who raised him .  and with the simultaneous re-appearance of his best-friend from high-school and object of his unrequited love ( tim dekay ) , now divorced with two young sons , the fact of his homosexuality must be faced .  to complete the triangle , there's the tall , taciturn native american ( eric schweig ) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam .  this fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like "" welcome to my world "" and "" achin' , breakin' heart "" to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved .  in the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness .  sure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made .  and rob sweeney's photography of glacier national park is spectacular !  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" big eden "" is a charming , quirky , off-beat 7 .  it's a heart-warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end .

"oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents .  it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century .  stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house .  the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done .  at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal .  he is simply trying to tame it .  but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them .  stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon .  he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own .   "" nixon "" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws .  there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking .  sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president .  joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette .  she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon .  the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins .  everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing .  stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined .  he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element .  at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood .  the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere .  the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers .  still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .

"i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding .  it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder .  it is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) .  one of the bad guys was a surprise .  the pace is fast enough , there are some "" action "" scenes .  i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick .  julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together .  i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair !  her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color .  she could use some highlights .  they both do fine with their roles : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot "" cub "" reporter with the chicago globe .  they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie .  i like the one story focus .  other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman .  basically this movie is reasonably fun .  there is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery .  it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously .  i do give successful comedy high marks .

"it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents .  while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny .  a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik .  flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task .  when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way .  the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them .  the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey .  when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food .  when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food .  flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return .  instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors .  when he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes .  a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning .  the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative .  together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film .  its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material .

"i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review .  i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire "" wag the dog , "" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it .  quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that .  they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either .  a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's "" dr .  strangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that .  that said , "" wag the dog "" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them .  the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office .  the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood .  brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor .  as i said , "" wag the dog "" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform "" we have the right to fight for democracy . ""  another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village .  the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt .  william "" old shoe "" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho .  of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the "" fighting "" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis .  still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable .  regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ?  the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt .  schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it .  there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away .  with these plot holes , "" wag the dog "" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place .  brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off .  the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret .  motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project .  in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created .  i think it's fair to say that "" wag the dog "" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire .  still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one .  wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ?  with this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws .

"there was a lot riding on this movie .  everyone even moderately interested in the "" scream "" series was dying to know how it would end .  what would be the "" final act "" ?  this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "" scream "" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves .  no need to worry ; "" scream 3 "" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co .  so , how does the story go ?  as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems .  she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone .  but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off .  instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in "" eye for an eye "" ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him .  the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two .  not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) .  at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within "" scream "" has now become totally fictional .  nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene .  so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ?

"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy .  this new film has been underrated for no reason .  it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films .  it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two .  the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters .  the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children .  more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure "" .  the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate .  michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling .  constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children .  the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church .  later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million . ""  but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness .  sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin .  but god does not take payoffs .  the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican .  there is a moment in "" godfather iii "" where michael says : "" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal .  but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . ""   .  visually this film is as spectacular as the first two .  gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better .  but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection .  the third installment has only the plot and visuals .  some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films .  the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional .  the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars .  andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal .  violence is natural to him .  he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was .  however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless .  and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed .  the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films .  in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger .  this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed .  many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary .  i disagree .  it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family .  the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life .  it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times .  a man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him .  the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life .  the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed .  there is no turning back .  and no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely .  the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead .  here he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven  ",1
"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .  it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .  sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .  quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem .  but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors .  flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .  mostly it's laughable .  in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .  but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right .  iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .  but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .  unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression .  iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .  iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .  however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .  in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .  while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .  aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau .

"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit .  when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well ,  you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution .  what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic .  this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder . ""  i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away .  it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting .  the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally .  the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film .  the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach .  its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies .  the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without .  these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating .  the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized .  the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective .  humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed .  we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed .  he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita .  he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her .  the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace .  the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him .  the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ?  this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general .  in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits .  the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and  when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession .  the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through .  looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them .  they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was .  and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse .  i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here .  however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it .  it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had .  some of that is in the casting of the two leads .  jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert .  he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does .  he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience .  and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives .  and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible .  she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character .  it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time .  when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her .  there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship .  the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith .  in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish .  and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning .  as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she's about half of them .  it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first .  and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she's nothing more .  the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price .  langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original .  quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk .  langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him .  as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise .  this version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening .  the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich .  the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita .  more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it .  by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .

"the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups .  for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) .  for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids .  all in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing .  but first the basics .  based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using .  shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace .  petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides .  he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle .  as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few .  an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain .  lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from "" snow white "" has shown him the way .  all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife .  the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! "" )  farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds .  shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend .  they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet .  for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well .  the movie references a great many other flicks , from "" babe "" ( "" that'll do , donkey .  that'll do "" ) to "" the graduate . ""  but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney .  the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! ""   ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it's a small world . ""  which brings me to disturbing point number one .  i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad .  the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known .  for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day .  and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer .  here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up !  put the past behind you !  there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms !  the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad .  beyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within .  it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature .  do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ?  the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers .  adding short jokes is simply mean .  still , "" shrek "" is a rollicking good time .  the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one .  to trot out a clich ? , "" shrek "" is fun for all ages .  parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing .

"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .  martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .  unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .  seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .  this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .  goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .  the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .  at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .  after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .  three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .  wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .  but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .  goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .  scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .  world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .  scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .  after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .  scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .  with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .  even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .  first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue .  then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .  this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .  same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .  nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .  but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .  however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .  such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .  fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .  he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film .  another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .  the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .  joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .  ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .  liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .  liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .  lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .  paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .  as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .  because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .

"are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ?  director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film "" next stop wonderland "" .  the two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other's orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion .  is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ?  does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ?  as the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ) .  rather , he is ending it with her .  arriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings .  in a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving .  it's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship .  he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief .  erin's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin .  to erin's embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a "" frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life "" .  eventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and "" poseurs "" .  alan , a plumber and aspiring marine biologist , first spots erin as he's cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium .  wearing a wet suit and goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish .  later , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away .  the movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing .  there are several subplots involving alan .  one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business .  another subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track .  a distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off .  the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy .  thankfully , his dream- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin's distant , yet fundamentally hopeful , personality .  the film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet .  co-writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships .  the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over .  when alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze .  it's a sweet , measured moment .  the disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair , yet we don't get to view their impending romance .  the film's inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one's life makes "" next stop wonderland "" a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions , shallow characters and overdone special effects .

"a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july !  >from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters .  1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting .  as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar .  not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics .  as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .  the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it .  however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film .  and to my surprise , it grew on me .  the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .  see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .  also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out .  carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .  for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few .  perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .  and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .  the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie .  i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .  also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing .  still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out .  or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . )  hell , that's what i do every day .

"there's a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election .  based on the book written by "" anonymous "" ( actually former "" newsweek "" writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton .  but he doesn't actually play stanton .  he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) .  the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton .  he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers .  richard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president's advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign's eccentric "" tougher than dirt "" incriminator .  together they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race .  in its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue .  but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it's characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent .  seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look .  and the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden .  at occasions , you can't help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste .  there are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry's story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film .  having said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch .  but frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ?  most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film .  but as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public's opinion .  although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is .  thankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it's scary .

"seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) .  when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine . ""  i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea .  it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale .  the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it .  we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk .  he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this .  somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him .  it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade .  i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit .  however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer .  the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to .  the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original .  most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable .  thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development .  much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie .  pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would .  he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be .  we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him .  newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run .  as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed .  most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole .  the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar .  the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning .  back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering .  since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic .  my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure .  a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff .  we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful .  aside from a few minor , general flaws , "" donnie brasco "" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development .  it may be routine , but it's good , and that's respectful .

"warning : contains what the matrix is .  rated r for sci-fi violence .  starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix .  i'll tell you i was .  i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen .  now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it .  what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow .  now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show .  don't be fooled , this movie has a big story .  and big chunks of talky moments .  but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above .  ok now to the story .  well this may take a while .  ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix .  a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world .  he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be .  but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him .  laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves .  but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were .  yeah there were some in the first half but not enough .  the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie .  now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie .  some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking .  the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained .  but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long .  one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained .

"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again .  there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice .   "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' ""  of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety .  you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience .  experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts .  trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point .  juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan .  a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) .  goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious .  goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen .  the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing .  however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy .  this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems .  take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner .  the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum .  tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room .  she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists .  just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door .  she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience .  this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery .  there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers .  we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet .  the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all .  there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives .  a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor .  surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life .  her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner .  the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this .  in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family .  as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles .  preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy .  then she falls over , dead .  for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , "" keep eating !  this is the last meal your mother ever made ! ""  crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal .  the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful .  by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline .  instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble .  because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown .  in this case , the showdown is against the ramen .  if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded .  it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .

"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic .  postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview .  so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ?  my best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull .  no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made .  it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date .  to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at .  the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage .  but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies .  there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise .  i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you :  the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic .  we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor .  bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure .  what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage .  we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family .  rose is to be wed to a man she does not love .  we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game .  the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins .  add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy .  i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship .  she is a pleasure to see on screen .  when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters .  the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on .  the effects are tremendous .  from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other .  we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen .  my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard .  when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles .  titanic runs far too long .  the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length .  and , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends .  don't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's  not a bad as i am making it out to be .  it really is an exceptionaly well-made film .  the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period .  the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction .  this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound .  cameron has certainly made his best film to date .  unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate .  it just doesn't have a strong supporting story .  it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside .  it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for .  i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews .  it is a film worth seeing .  i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office .  with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video .  this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts .  titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox .  i give titanic 3 stars ( .  that's not bad .  ron epstein  riginally posted in home theater forum ===  ",1
"saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes .  starring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie .  it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 .  tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action .  action , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him .  after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie .  i'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes .  tom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) .  this time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it .  occasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance .  edward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today .  spielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes .  and what battle scenes they are !  they're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen .  the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique .  the gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting .  this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults .  other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making .  the cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb .  it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen .  but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing .  it is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak .  the film never really makes any profound statements .  this is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words .  still , the script could of been a lot better .  thankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines .  saving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting .  this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile .  it really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie .

"after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise .  this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart .  in fact it's not even a comedy .  it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs .  based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness .  rob gordon was a dj .  it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life .  now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york .  when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose .  decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important .  he starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists "" .  and the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy .  though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first .  where did he go wrong ?  was it he that screwed up ?  or maybe life just stinks ?  while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together .  with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me .  although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word .  and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned .  he is simply superb .  it is as much his movie as it is frears' .  the film would not be the same without him .  cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony .  most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off .  his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen .  the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job .  both ______ and jack black are fabulous .  even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful .  however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick .  this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination .  he is simply a joy to behold .  otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend .  pretty much like edward norton's "" keeping the faith "" , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry .  it's a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself .  nothing seems unreal or staged .  it reflects reality as a mirror .  as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character .  you feel and think and reflect .  this effect has become a rarity nowadays .  although it's primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music .  rob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs .  music is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives .  and so does the movie .  it is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments .  in the end , you have gained something while watching it .  it's not the film of the century or even of the year .  it's not an special effects extravaganza .  it doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed .  it's a small movie about the big things .  and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time .

""  coming april 9 are two more of this type : "" never been kissed "" and "" go , "" and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire "" election "" and the teen horror-comedy "" idle hands . ""  jeesh !  out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum "" she's all that . ""  although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" a modern-day version of shakespeare's "" the taming of the shrew "" ( "" she's all that "" got its inspiration from "" pygmalion "" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's "" the breakfast club . ""  and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in "" she's all that ? "" ) .  the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) .  although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to .  kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .  complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey .  as you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) .  at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she's all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you're vapor "" ) .  since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained .  aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot .  aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( "" 3rd rock from the sun "" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings .  as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries "" the '60s "" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her .  even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality .  no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does .  heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles .  one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set .  in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has .  one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal .  allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl "" chill "" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good .  although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters .  in one very funny scene , chastity asks , "" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? ""  at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant .   "" 10 things i hate about you "" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s .  it also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave '80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) .  by the film's end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) .  luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about "" 10 things i hate about you , "" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten .

"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources .  each review compared this film to the truman show .  why ?  the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television .  other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other .  reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e .  the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies .  when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman .  the same goes for the thin red line , as well .  when it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever .  critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards .  this is why i think pleasantville was underrated .  if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves .  sure , it wasn't perfect , and it wasn't very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history .  with the exception of don knotts as the annoying "" tv repairman "" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm's tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50's sitcom "" pleasantville "" to escape from his feuding parents .  his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes .  but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90's terms such as "" like "" , "" whatever "" , and "" cool "" make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be .  the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote .  their new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way .  their new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville .  after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form .  it's just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don't want it to end .   "" mary sue "" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color .  soon we learn that these people don't know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color .  this eventually sparks a racial war between the "" coloreds "" and the "" black & whites . ""  entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , "" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . ""  yes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent .  but the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it's what i least expected .  gary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece-he just tries to convey moral messages within his work .  take for example big and dave , his past films .  big-be careful what you wish for .  dave-good or bad lying is still lying .  did these movies win big awards ?  no , but they won the heart of millions .  pleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn't for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films .  pleasantville : a- ad2am "" i almost lost my nose . . . and  i like it .  i like breathing through it .

"usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug , but not the big lebowski .  the new offering from the creators of 1996's critical hit fargo , is to say the least , wildly entertaining .  originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother's movies , and the big lebowski is insanely original .  it begins oddly enough when jeff "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) is mistaken for a millionaire , jeff "" the big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) , who's wife , bunny ( tara reid ) owes money all over town .  two goons , out to collect on bunny's debt break into dude's house .  they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug .  the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team ( steve buscemi & john goodman , respectively . )  he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug .  he does this , and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper .  this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments .  the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly .  also several great supporting roles , john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus .  the coen's script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining .  i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo , but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998 .  if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one , if not they give this one a try its a little different .

"everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with "" progress . ""  giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis .  his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth .  this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns "" erstwhile fogy "" giles into a three-dimensional human being .  despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love .  and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places .  giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go .  what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii .  a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress .  just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight .  giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes .   ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . )  eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located .  bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) .  eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice .  but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant .  love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that .  in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect .  it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it .  in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target .  in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited .  from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame .  it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions .  jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .  he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie .  meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .  love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a "" fish out of water "" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .  yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots .  it has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .

"vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! '  and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season .  austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity .  the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place .  myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr . evil , who is given much of the spotlight here .  there's an early scene in which dr . evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself .  most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were .  happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr . evil and the other guests .   ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! !  you want a piece of me ? ' )  the audience was in stitches .  there are many good things about this sequel .  dr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry .  mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all .  mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber .  this works surprisingly well .  afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment .  oh , yes . . .  the plot .  after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil .  in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods .  here , it's time travel .  dr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber .  there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless .  meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle .  once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon .  in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' .  if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me .  ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers .  but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss .  while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits .  the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner .  robert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character .  one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee .  there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) .  but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny .  don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . .  of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression .  her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her .  and as for fat bastard . . .  well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far .  but my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! !  but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that .  this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot .  and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection .  if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more .

"with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall's life is rife with complications .  and with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent .  but margaret's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated .  her teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd .  his mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau .   "" stay away from my son "" margaret warns darby reese .  her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse .  there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight .  the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest .  with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard .  but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated .  soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova .  alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day .  but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected .  based on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel "" the blank wall , "" "" the deep end "" is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( "" suture "" ) .  it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese .  the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel .  but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton .  swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( "" caravaggio , "" "" edward ii , "" "" the last of england "" ) , plays margaret hall in "" the deep end "" and , like charlotte rampling in this year's "" under the sand , "" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance .  margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being .  the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities .  many can relate to that , of course ; it's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors .  the end is deep all right , and there isn't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton's canon .

"corey yuen's latest film , "" hero "" is notable on two fronts .  first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production .  secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao .  the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai .  poverty and crime rule most of china .  a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier .  tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army .  wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation .  their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love .  wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction .  after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her .  first they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous .  unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see's night club .  the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn .  jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home .  see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder .  see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing .  unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung .  the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow .  the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung's "" eastern condors "" , is a marvelous surprise .  his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious .  the stand-out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments , with a stellar performance .  his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride .  his gangster is almost non-violent , in that he only retaliates , never instigates violence .  but when the time comes to fight , yuen biao has never looked better .  corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late .  the lighting , cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch .  the action scenes do not disappoint either .  this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i've seen in some time , actually surpassing jackie chan's work in both 'rumble in the bronx' and 'first strike' .  the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible .  an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed .  also noteworthy is the score for the film , done in a marvelously lush orchestral style , not representative of most hong kong fare .  i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both "" titanic "" and "" rosewood "" as best of the year .  all in all , "" hero "" marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers .  this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing .

"labelling is sometimes everything .  in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own .  walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors .  producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones .  on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america .  to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago .  instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city .  the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx .  that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce .  on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city .  crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus .  police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs .  the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs .  upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status .  however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year .  the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly .  if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably .  the future was much worse than his vision .  the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities .  their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime .  in their vocabulary , word "" arms "" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns .  they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own .  many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors .  some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour .  despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film .  the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes .  the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie .  editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory .  the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable .  yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity .  best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains .  michael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot .  all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies .

"america has finally gotten what it's needed for years : a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma .  regretfully it's only a movie .  president james marshall ( harrison ford ) is fed up with terrorist activities .  teaming up with the russian government , he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek , a reactionary general ready to re-unite the soviet union under his fascist reign .  during a celebration dinner , marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists .   "" it's your turn to be afraid , "" he declares .  returning home on air force one , he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally .  ultra-nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov ( gary oldman ) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released .  marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule ( which clinton says doesn't exist in real life ) but refuses , preferring to stay and fight .  director wolfgang peterson ( "" das boot "" , "" in the line of fire "" , "" outbreak "" takes the over-used "" die hard "" theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold-your-breath intensity .  if you can take your eyes off the screen , steal a look at the audience .  everyone is totally engrossed .  the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it .  oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder -- he does it so well .  when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead , you know that he's over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become .  you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time .  when korshonov executes passengers , there is a frightening reality to it .  the guns in this film are deadly weapons , not cartoons .  harrison ford has done one role for several years .  his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here .  marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job .  realistically , he's a man afraid , but not afraid to act .  ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero .  indiana jones in the oval office .  he and oldman's archetypes match up perfectly .  the other roles also go to accomplished actors .  glenn close as the determined but unsure vice-president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she's not quite ready for .  dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority ( "" i'm in charge here ! "" )  is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance .  of course the politics are all wrong .  a cowboy president ( even down to his name ) with big guns shoots his way through problems .  much like the american collective memory of jfk's camelot , the image is wondrous if you don't look too deep .  the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film , but they work here .  no matter what political spin you put on the story , the movie is an outstanding one .  i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country's future : not a common belief nowadays .  now if we only can get ford to run for president .  just because one actor didn't work out as chief executive doesn't mean that a different one couldn't .

" "" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher .  with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story .  he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation .  from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church .  well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion .  instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god .  and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments .  instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures .  when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene .  the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters .  with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims .  the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work .  robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier .  rarely has a movie been such a labor of love .  with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher .  duvall has every movement down pat .  even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy .  he dances and claps all the way .  sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive .   "" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent .  and they lap it up .  people jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! ""  and mean it .  the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable .  but sonny is no saint .  it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett .  jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed .  sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever .  the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock .  in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church .  he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money .  and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks .  a man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , "" i quit school because i didn't like recess . ""  in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while .  his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies .  billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker .  his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take .  although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely .  and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits .  a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film .  the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 .  it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .

"i love this movie , and i've just seen for the umptenth time .  unfortunately , it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it .  it's my mission in life to spread the word : see this movie !  fred , george , doug and howie are reaching middleage .  three of them have a wife , kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay .  only fred is still a bachelor .  together they take the local train every morning to work in town .  on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar , fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress .  he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night .  since they always split everything four ways , they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well , kathy .  however , kathy isn't completly honest to them .  in fact , she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male .  with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper .  ok , have one thing clear though .  the romantic rendezvous' between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent .  the script stays above the waist - or to be precise , above the neck .  noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress , the four guys call her their 'companion' .  the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above 15 years , but that only shows how long ago 1962 was .  small children could watch this without being corrupted .  kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie , even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student .  james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies .  i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife .  tony randall is funny as always .  1962 was more than 35 years ago .  how many accountants , copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work ?  this is the white middle class , i can't remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use .  these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves .  perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology ?

"a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite .  they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too .  they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb .  men in black is a four-star three-star film .   ( hope you could follow that one )  men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun .  just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use .  after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ?  men in black is , of course , the organization which "" moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth "" .  nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes .  the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof .  naturally nobody believes his story .   .   .  nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of .  edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib .  edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) .  james edwards no longer exists .  meet agent jay .  agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about "" regular "" duties .  eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play .  a "" bug "" has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it .  the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the "" bug "" does .  barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely .  it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed .  a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be .  this is one of those movies that is just "" fun "" and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer .  will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch .  definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me !

"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason .   "" good will hunting "" is about one of those people .  the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius .  he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino .  and he works at mit . . . as the janitor .  one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete .  the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it .  so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove .  and , duh , it's done again .  of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will .  before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy .  after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" ) .  finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up .  turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not .  it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge .  and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction .  is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ?  should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ?  this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should .  i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all .  it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it .  the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together .  we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar .  there are tons of individual moments that i adored .  i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them .  i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends .  there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch .  and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable .  like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter .  however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either .  the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten .  take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face .  we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times .  but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do .  also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action .  we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one .  their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human .  maybe it was just me .  and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten .  and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten .  we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else .  minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character .  the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness .  sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable .  the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human .  i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing .  while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of "" to die for , "" the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this "" best picture "" deal ? ) .  and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .

"contact is a film that tries to do several different things .  it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) .  the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals .  the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files .  the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else .  they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person .  the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey .  most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens .  scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between .  the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species .  the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed .  still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society .  the two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists .  palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology .  then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions .  contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself .  the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss .  for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction .  the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( "" i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth "" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development .  instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments .  granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else .  the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures .  even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film .  contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable .  and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .

"warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film .  or lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff .  in other words , it's a walter hill film !  with a john milius script !  i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches .  these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb .  and we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you .  in particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff .  torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone .  as to women . . .  well , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will .  women exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over .  gosh !  just like the old days . . .  frankly , this is a pretty good movie , if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff .  the cinematography is excellent , the cast of characters is broad and has texture , the script is quite good , and the film lets you keep up with what's happening yourself , without spelling it out to you .  i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up .  finally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups .

"no matter what you suspect , this isn't your usual action thriller .  the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer .  it's one of those movies that , after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end , you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light .  plot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me .  keyser soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason .  it's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- "" keyser soze "" in latin means "" an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer .

"the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year .  we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office .  this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy .  i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them .  that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza .  in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell .  he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra .  evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable .  rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there .  also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) .  now in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead . ""  the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book .  along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra .  not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt .  don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time .  this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers .  on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide .  there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though .  the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world .  we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin .  these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy .  as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country .  in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles .  when playing "" george "" in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone .  i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens .  in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle .  although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast .  weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film .  the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time .  evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention .  in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part .  in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works .  there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work .  the mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these .  i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them .  the cinematography is amazing in the mummy .  particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians .  the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography .  from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch .  the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .

"felix ( sami bouajila , "" the siege "" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france .  when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in "" the adventures of felix . ""  writers/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy "" jeanne and the perfect guy , "" embracing that typically american genre .  their second effort , "" the adventures of felix , "" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself .  felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends .  when he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away .  felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of "" cocktails "" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot .  he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny .  along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations .  on the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police .  following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family .  his journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , "" my little brother , "" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix .  they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on .  he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled "" my grandmother , "" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to .  she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father .  in the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled "" my cousin , "" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles .  he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled "" my sister . ""  he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would .  on the final leg of the journey titled "" my father , "" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son .   "" the adventures of felix "" has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery .  first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix .  he is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of "" cocktails , "" and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself .  as he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally .  bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen .  the cast of characters making up felix's new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way .  patachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix .  ariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had .  only the "" cousin "" chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix's "" family . ""   "" the adventures of felix "" does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning .  it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside .  i give it a b+ .

"waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . '  in the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film .  does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ?  through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility .  expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria .  in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar .  deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip .  we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar .  what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse .  what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless .  to the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos .  lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness .  the shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions .  as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well .  the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality .  because the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability .  as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob .  this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject .  while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large .  we see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage .  with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching .  in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail .  in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind .  lang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior .  as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side .  lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts .  using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty .  reprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .

"i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend .  the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity .  i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film .  maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy .  maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin .  but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life .  the story of serendipity is simple .  two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle .  charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink .  but with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera .  sara declares that if this "" thing "" -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future .  years later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts .  what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that "" thing "" was right after all .  fortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative .  coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity .  both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand .  but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture .

"it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it .  it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off .  the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack .  he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks .  he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process .  his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them .  he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years .   "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake .  we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides .  or at least , that's the intention .  the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him .  when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere .  coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair .  he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up .  he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle .  but danny won't .  he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago .  the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white .  we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on .  to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them .  and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true .   "" american history x "" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next .  in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year .  one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving ) .  another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison .  and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year .  there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time ) .  norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble .  in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best .  there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando .  that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing .  sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be .  it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece .  the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon .  some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the "" fat skinhead , "" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled .  furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there .  even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified .  though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from "" boy meets world , "" and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs .  as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed .  sorta .   "" american history x "" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential .  somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus .  although he aimed for the directing credit to go to "" alan smithee , "" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn't allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that's the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) .  kaye's right in that it's not up to par , even if he's not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par .  this will not be a "" do the right thing "" for the late 90s .  yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) .  and even if it isn't perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he's done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience .

"not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies .  like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations .  also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces .  and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film .  all that is missing is a discussion of god .  which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master .  in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind .  nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms .  once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards .  one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is .  though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "" style "" at all .  whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary .  the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors .  it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting .  much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is .  there are a few missteps .  for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film .  this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout .  and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced .  for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention .  it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film .  in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it .  there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe .  nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart .  though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen .  needless to say , it is also very depressing at times .  but for many of us , of course , so is life .  and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .

"it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system .  no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either .  the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority .  small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on .  there's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government's been long worried about the younger people getting "" americanised "" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition .  the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex .  does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ?  larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net .  but even with such actions , americans remain undecided .  the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire .  what they have ignored is actually a great picture .  woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers .  and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly .  the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself .  edward norton plays their jerky lawyer .  the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids .  god's damnation .  but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level .  friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences .  to go beyond good and evil .  this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally .  because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah .  but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases .  there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities .  this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society .

"you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to .  in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits .  no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) .  essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking .  it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative .  but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is .  but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle .  it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman .  i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ?  if you like something so much , why even question it ?  again , the storyline is as cliched as they come .  tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner .  fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business .  little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity .  the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen .  sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship .  all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax .  but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does .  when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling .

"what if one of our cities became the target for terror ?  what can we do ?  what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ?  what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ?  so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world .  it is the land of opportunities .  it is the land of freedom .  but what if it became the new target ?  this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality .  when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice .  the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him . ""  then all hell breaks loose in new york .  a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians .  a broadway theater is bombed .  hostages are taken at a school .  as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law .  devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil .  another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities .  his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o !  f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies .  hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal .  but the attacks escalate .  the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy .  the land is under siege .  they have lost control . . a  terror is coming from within . .  what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life .  it reflects reality .  and that's why it makes such an impact .  edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season .  the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously .  and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective .  he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) .  he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved .  the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii .  there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the "" greater good . ""  in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom .  was that what the terror !  ists really wanted ?  this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially .  but to me these protests seem unnecessary .  zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys .  the script is therefore wonderfully balanced .  agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american .  and it is quite often you hear lines such as "" my first boyfriend was palestinian .  they seduce you with their suffering "" or "" they love this country as much as we do . ""  but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority .  more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military .  and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any !  way .  denzel washington is dashing as always .  in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual .  anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . .  bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand .  the film is elegantly shaped .  the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong .  zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism .  he tightens the intensity as the events progress .  and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising .  it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich .  nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values .  it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey .  it has courage enough to get involved in politics .  it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense .  i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down .  but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of .

"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it .  probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's .  however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made .  corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life .  one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him .  her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion .  maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another .  they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover .  lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend .  this is not clear to lucas , however .  he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen .  we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally .  they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie .  surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school .  the next scene is brilliant .  maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally .  she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened .  he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion .  in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters .  but maggie is written smarter than that .  she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him .  next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) .  he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend .  what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks .  of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next .  cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship .  this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone .  she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt .  maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body .  this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires .  desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room .  it's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) .  lucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance .  this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team .  the last third of the film revolves around this attempt .  while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not .  there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up .  dave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps .  lucas is filled with great performances .  forget everything you know about corey haim .  back in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain .  kerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her .  sheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas .  there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks .  also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar .  when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that .  lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics .  but hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald .  it deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy .

( the title is taken from brooks' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . )  with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence .   ( further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . )  different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream .  by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives .  at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one's work .  this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen .  don't miss it .  -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by errol morris edited by karen schmeer and shondra merrill cinematography by robert richardson music by caleb sampson u . s . , 1997 --------------------------------------------------------------  ",1
"after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last .  redford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he's proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera .  ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed .  while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um ,  realism , and i've never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing .  the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery .  scott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi .  grace's horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad .  annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace's newly-broken spirit .  eventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed "" horse whisperer "" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind .  eventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom's family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer .  the horse whisperer is delicately made .  i dare say lyrical , since to many people's ear , that word is synonymous with boring .  hardly .  the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story .  scott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p .  robert richardson's photography casts montana as heaven on earth .   ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . )  the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom .  he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse's motivation .  unfortunately , one of the horse whisperer's only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford .  i liked both of them , but i didn't necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly .  luckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn't quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters' complex relationships together .

"weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them .  in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out .  it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank .  by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants .  `seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras .  for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him .  thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program .  in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through .  this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it .  for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it .  truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed .  the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment .  cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images .  as well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece "" zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully .  if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's "" wife "" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete .  there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film .  they wear buttons asking `how will it end ? '  i couldn't wait to know myself , though i didn't exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years .  ",1
"film adaptation of hunter s . thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title .  director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) )   "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam .  plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race .  during their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls .  the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use .  critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess .  if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels .  if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) .  note : i have not read thompson's book .  having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level .  this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot .  it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine .  it was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a' changing "" in the states .  johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop .  during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole .  i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk .  the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo .  i couldn't believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) .  word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible .  plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others .  other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed .  this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream .  and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind .  little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine .  bill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam .  johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what's eating gilbert grape ?   ( 7/10 ) .  in 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he'd tried every drug by the age of 14 .  johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now .  johnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself "" mr . stench "" , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose "" winona forever "" tattoo had to be altered to "" wino forever "" after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called "" p "" , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a .

"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina .  the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain .  one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station .  the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away .  the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads .  at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act .  that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave .  deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) .  the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered .  over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over .  other plot elements are thrown in for good measure .  wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent .  braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate .  and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful .  the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners .  deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense .  the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting .  deceiver has the power to grab an audience .  unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing .  for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers .  it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications .  of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic .  police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner .  but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details .  deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute .  the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours .  the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened .  moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks .  the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere .  there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models .  cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look .  some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks .  as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting .  roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be .  the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective .  both play their characters like familiar types .  penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety .  some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors .  renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature .  rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition .  one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience .  plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters .  the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers .  occasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort .

"i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou .   ( huh ? )  well , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in .  he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck .  against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities .  the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ?  a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle .  oh , and its much better than any of those .  sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture .  he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do .  i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course .  one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line .  in malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story .  it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water .  sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts .  raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters .  i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film .  and then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood .  if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok .  he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here .  it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so .  jacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought .  i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said .  here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry .  though the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters .  paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) .  perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture .  a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming .  but at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts .

"this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree .  although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers .  it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one .  `a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why .  ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable .  evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well .  here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season :  1 ) period detail .  this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail .  shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head .  shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing .  on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration .  director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality .  i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like .  2 ) mom and dad .  both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles .  it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured .  for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues .  in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord .  his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment .  which brings us to . . . .  3 ) the comic situations .  there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story' .  moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish .  i am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard .  again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry .  the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree .  i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes .  not only is it funny , it's often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places .  i plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition .  why don't you ?

"one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting .  the main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone .  they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey .  carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there .  when nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life .  screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients .  dr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing .  however , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug .  the performances are all very commendable .  sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role .  kenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital .  joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey .  charles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch .  some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters .  as a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part .  other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks .  both jacques and windsor play their parts well .  patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth .  the jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing .  although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors .  a must-see carry on movie .

"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable .  you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is .  sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch .  this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun .  one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story .  this rule applies highly to kiss the girls .  there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made .  however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through .  well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up .  unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits .  that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery .  however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film .  plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality .  we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero .  he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself .  obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene .  at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days .  this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross .  however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . .  before she is abducted .  dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself .  because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful .  after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods .  remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out .  when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall .  after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice .  from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive .  many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional .  the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form .  what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness .  the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us .  sometimes a simple shot is the best one .  however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight .  the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way .  the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well .  the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing .  however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors .  morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors .  detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven .  because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself .  the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses .  in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible .  her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully .  we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream .  the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it .  cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character .  tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either .  gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes .  so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job .  some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year .  two other essential aspects of the film are quite good .  director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer .  he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes .  however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half .  part of the blame falls on david klass .  i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts .  while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible .  thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent .  none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced .  one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer .  i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) .  kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex .  with all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain .  in fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances .  the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart .  this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through .  morgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt .  i must also say that i loved the ending .  the showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer .  perhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway .

"the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made .  i know that is very sweeping statement , so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot .  2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science .  most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting .  the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town .  something bad happens to them .  pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight .  apparently everyone in the town is dead .  the authorities call a "" wildfire alert , "" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada .  two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins .  some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive .  they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712 , "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb .  what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows .  their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict .  what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet .  they barely call off the bombing in time .  but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out .  this triggers the lab's last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb .  to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow .  much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts .  but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw .  the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists .  to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting .  we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don't expect .  this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it .  it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body's wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood .

"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail .  he says to a black congregation "" . . . if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me . "" )  well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy .  beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california .  the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action .  the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy .  when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days .  his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care .  first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name .  then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination .  his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements .  bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience .  he is hit hard with questions about his voting record .  he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up .  since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity .  they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made .  the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers .   ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j .  fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth . ""  that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie .  when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about . )  the experience is liberating .  with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth .  he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway .  why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ?  bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on .  he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something .  chicken wings , appropriately enough .  bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives .  when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment .  with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product .   ( you go , warren ! )  when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews .  that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them .  he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap .  the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers .  from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth .  his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy .  he's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad .  his lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth .  eventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? )  overtakes the politics , which is too bad .  screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him .  there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer .  these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin .  still , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen .  as the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) .  as an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth .  as a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) .  someone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck .  it's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics .  after all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news .  just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants .  just don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies .

"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it .  even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms .  so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen .  as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money .  he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey .  few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall .  and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion .  sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve .  he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals .  unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church .  duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses .  one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher .  faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper .  at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal .  not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears .  he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again .  in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling .  after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple .  re-christening himself as "" the apostle e . f . , "" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives .  but , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress .  duvall has made his intentions in making "" the apostle "" clear .  in a recent article in "" newsweek , "" he wrote : "" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . .  but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . ""  the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - "" the apostle "" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter .  after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual .  his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to .   "" i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny , "" he says .  when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him .  the main theme to emerge from "" the apostle "" is the fact that good can come from any situation .  sonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact .  however , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him .  in his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him .  and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment .  it is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws .  weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves .  watching duvall on-screen , it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting .  as sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year .  because he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human .  as a director , duvall feels that less is more .  his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion .  there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups .  duvall knew that the power of the film's characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn't need to be artificially enhanced .  in this way , "" the apostle "" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality .

"urban legend surprised me .  based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .  thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year .  you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the  only person you didn't suspect !  however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment .  it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year .  the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .  maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt ) .  or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks .  more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise .  i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film .  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .  one problem , though .  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?  i thought not .  predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company .  it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line .  naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off .  and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !  a decapitation .  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .  so who is it this time ?  the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends .  a-ha .  or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?  like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit .  and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect .  i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due .  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .   * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca  ",1
"insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america .  as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold .  throughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism .  parker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal !  musical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) .  apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- "" south park "" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal !  also offers up some pretty decent laughs .  the aforementioned `ute' indian tribe that packer's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) .  stone's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt' or revealing what's underneath his muff cap .  jason mchugh's character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings .  as i mentioned before , parker's songs are very catchy .  you'll be hard pressed to get `it's a shpadoinkle day' out of your head once you've heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every "" south park "" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) .  other songs you'll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper's song' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard' ( the rousing finale ) .  thankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut's songs are .  released as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd .  the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) .  there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films .  as for the dvd . . .  well , that's a different story .  probably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal !  the musical !  the dvd is a massive achievement .  presented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal !  specific extras .  the first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i've ever seen on any disc .  the picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts .  add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven't scratched the surface of the extras .  there's also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! .  it's good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves .  kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time .

"the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made .  a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget .  in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives .  the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together .  michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group .  after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works .  three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married .  after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times .  this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war .  the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act .  the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future .  the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong .  the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river .  this prison , run by the v . c . ,  initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other .  steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate .  michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun .  personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes .  the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated .  michael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital .  michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero .  he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him .  he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam .  the third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette .  only in this game , you play for money .  michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him .  the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home .  a very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed .  the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling .  do not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you .

"the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : "" it mu5t be found . ""  so what , exactly , is the fifth element ?  after seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think .  but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen .  the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film .  speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it .  figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) .  all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest .  what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain .  the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last .  the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film .  but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever .  in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour .  gaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film .  while besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience .  for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre .  i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed .  at first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly .  not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno .  the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring .  then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot .  the story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element .  while still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be .  the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward .  as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters .  this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the "" enemy "" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made .  still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory .  it is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams .

"at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember .  the 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ?  not in your dreams !  imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you .  believe it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter .  the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious .  majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert .  as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) .  they soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces .  frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals .  as the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it .  `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie .  three kings is much smarter than that .  as the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray .  i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity .  this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant .  action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence .  they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts .  not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) .  great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director .  three kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least .  highly recommended .

"there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days .  stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ?  he's in "" there's something about mary , "" which i * still * haven't seen .  and he's in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri .  now there's "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl .  there's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially .  ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting . ""  the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs .   "" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit .  a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah . ""  as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .  unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .  one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave . ""  stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .  while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .   "" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .  stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time .  janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .  stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top .  the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see "" permanent midnight "" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .

"seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture]  modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes .  the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it .   "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends .  one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story .  firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras .  everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative .  but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult .  labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll .  for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic .  another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus .  we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown .  the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater .  no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background .  we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest .  the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives .  first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is .  barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else .  mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something .  labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two .  obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow .  another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything .  their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship .  if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area .  it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ?  what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ?  labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating .  two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) .  cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard . ""  somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way .  he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him .  patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is .  cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her .  she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another .  she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable .  i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film .  the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom .  the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating .  for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them .  one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be .  since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it .  are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ?  i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people .  often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie .  but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end .  although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal .  in what way "" your friends and neighbors "" is supposed to work is open to interpretation .  it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically .  still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .

"i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before .  pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films .  have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ?  more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff .  i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad .  it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered .  somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography .  the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .  but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time .  nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .  meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive .  after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor .  he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday .  angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .  seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .  the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .  cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .  it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .  the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .  but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .  it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it .  they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .  filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .  based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending .  most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .  nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .

"october sky is a rare oddity in cinema : a self-proclaimed "" uplifting "" film that is actually uplifting !  based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam , rocket boys , october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream .  it's 1957 , and for the boys of coalwood , west virginia , there's not much hope of a rosy future .  coalwood is a coal mining town , and , except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship , most of coalwood's boys are destined to work in the mine .  but , in october 1957 , an event happens that sparks one boy to dream .  the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) to dream a future of rocketry and space travel .  of course , homer's parents ( chris cooper and natalie canderday ) aren't quite sure what to make of their son's unusual interests .  homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley ( laura dern ) , a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair .  and so , with stars in his eyes , and thoughts of scholarships in his head , homer enlists the help of three other boys ( william lee scott , chad lindberg and chris owen ) and begins to build a rocket .  but , do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny ?  there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky .  nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched .  however , miraculously , october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls , making the exact right moves at the exact right times .  a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness .  jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film .  >from the outset of the film , he is immediately likable , and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience .  unfortunately , while october sky focuses on homer , the other three kids get the short end of the stick .  they remain little more than placeholders reading "" insert friend here "" .  of the adults in the film , chris cooper is the most fully realized character .  the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child's dreams , but , instead , shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town , but is too stubborn to realize what that is .  director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge .  however , there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far .  scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial .  however , these lapses are minimal , and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course .  the problem with many so-called "" uplifting "" films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat .  october sky never resorts to that level , and yet , manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits .

"more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office .  during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope .   "" ben-hur . ""   "" cleopatra . ""   "" the robe . ""   "" sparticus . ""   "" the fall of the roman empire . ""   "" quo vadis . ""  sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood .  since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" ) .  yet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now .   "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a . d . 180 .  roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting .  however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again .  when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered .  maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son .  a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa .   ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . )  an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds .  proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena .  of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads .  when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete .  our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) .  the similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess .  also , like mel gibson's epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger .  it's a simple tale of good versus evil .  maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family .  commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience .  the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate .   "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? ) .  there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences .   ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . )  lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife .  joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance .  in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride .  throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil .  i've been a russell crowe fan since "" romper stomper . ""  this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in "" l .  a . confidential "" and "" the insider "" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre .  the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role .  i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar .  my only major quibble with "" gladiator "" is its stylized look .  several scenes are tinted .  we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in "" payback "" and "" the matrix . ""  i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads .  in "" payback "" it was merely annoying , but in "" gladiator "" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic .   ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . )  also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously .   ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . )  with a more realistic look , "" gladiator "" could be even more satisfying than "" braveheart "" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion .  bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices .

"at one point during brian de palma's crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : "" can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time ? ""  fucking good question , that .  it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history .  yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick .  the overall structure is similar to howard hawks' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking .  pacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream .  and live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder .  from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he's not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) .  soon he's the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing .   "" never do your own stash "" , warns one character early in the film .  as sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls .  writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here .  stone's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development .  montana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience .  a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits .  pacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting .  pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life .  only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she's happy to oblige .  this isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well .  as director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva .  the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola .  where he differs from , say , coppola's godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment .  coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel .  and it perfectly suits the material .  the only major botch is giorgio moroder's mostly crap synthesier score .  it's just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes .  as expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn't be watching gangster movies if that upsets you .  at over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic , and if you're a fan of the genre you'll love f * * k-filled minute of it .

"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here !  it's title : starship troopers .  and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 .  i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour .  after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review .  starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem .  as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film .  in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film .  starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether .  while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s . ""  am i being to generous to this film ?  perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races .  in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction .  the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to .  starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style .  id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role .  this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species .  the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects .  however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy .  sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization .  more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends .  and they should be .  i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film .  this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average .  it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) .  starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads .  mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original .  stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" ,  these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously .  however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way .  after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw .  we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) .  rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms .  however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot .  however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico .  unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy .  this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch .  carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up .  and as a result , dizzy signs up .  everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry .  the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships .  in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects .  an hour into the film , the war begins .  a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with .  the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) .  following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war .  the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else .  many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks .  a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense .  the troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it .  i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot .  it's about special effects and gory violence .  director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall .  verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood .  starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon .  the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it .  my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group .  the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women .  despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful .  while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear .  thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with .  the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you .  casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon .  to most guys , he will come across as artificial .  fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character .  dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character .  her dizzy is extremely likeable .  denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done .  jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film .  neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast .  however , he does give a good performance .  michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm .  his performance rises above the rest .  perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen .  unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars .  director verhoeven is the main star of the film .  his direction is fast and unrelentless .  he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride .  writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein .  the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny .  the dialogue is smart but not too smart .  we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered .  thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) .  amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues .  in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story .  the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage .  i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies .  oh , and the special effects are first rate .  starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity .  believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film .  it is extremely violent .  in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year .  however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain .  it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys .  and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world .  now that would be entertaining !

"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form .  it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre .  what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with .  what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ?  well . . . .  1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother .  2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis .  3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart .  4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 .  5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic .  6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends .  7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited .  8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so .  9 . there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years .  10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so .  11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song .  since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill . ' ""  and in some ways it is .  both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships .  but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant .  the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) .  after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it .  not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums .  of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule .  andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) .  maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy .  roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in "" sense and sensibility "" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died .  and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts .  as for peter , things seem okay . . .  the film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i've done lots of theatre myself ) .  and there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) .  the final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did .  maybe it's because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique .  that's really what makes "" peter's friends "" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another .  it's when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends .  not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s .  there are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears "" everybody wants to rule the world , "" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i'd put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old "" come on eileen "" ) , but this is the british 80s we're talking about .  oh well .  but anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing .  branagh's forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he's very good with making a less ambiguous film like this .  the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , "" no , but we have hollywood "" - punishment like that ) .  the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter's mansion .  a little note should be made about hugh laurie's performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i've never seen him actually act this dramatically .   "" peter's friends "" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don't know what kind i'll have ( like most people , i don't look forward to my high school reunion ) .  because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that .

"the latest epos from lars is a blast , although a rather moody one .  this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something .  the church ( calvinistic ) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower , they are considered being too unrestrained .  in these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess , played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson .  jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess . .  is just bess , a bit naive and innocent ( in every aspect of the word ) , at first .  at the wedding party we are told an anecdote , illustrating her infinite kindness , she once lend a bike to an stranger , her best friends bike however .  but bess is suffering in this scary religious society .  we soon take part in a funeral where a man , fallen off the orthodox path , is laid to rest while doomed to hell .  women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church .  when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend , almost manic , that her friends try to calm her down a bit .  the time has come when jan is to return to the rig , bess is falling into the darkness of depression , her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves .  she can't stand the thought of life without her husband .  we witness her dialogues with god ( she speaks both parts , paranoia ? )  convincing god to return jan from the oilrig , and her prayers are heard .  an accident on the rig bring him back , paralysed from the neck and down .  now he can't satisfy her need for physical love , he try to persuade her into finding a lover , with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail .  at first she resist , but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply .  imagine what this is doing to the poor girl ?  the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others .  the use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre .  the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant , though a bit too gloomy for my taste .  i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) .  emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances , this must be the reason for giving it the "" grand prix du jury "" in cannes this year ( although we had hoped for the "" palme d'or "" ) .  the screenplay is now available in print , the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july , just in time for the danish premiere .

"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me .  because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks .  as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something .  i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story .  no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies .  for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other .  there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on .  or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building .  again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing .  i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking .  but he simply uses the best tool for the job .  it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward .  the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet .  the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom . ""  his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story .   ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . )  we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old .  his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama .  a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before .  several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items .  the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own .  the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama .  scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk .  before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation .  sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice .  either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader .  >from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation .  it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child .  in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services .  but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage .  neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person .  certain patterns take shape over the years .  for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology .  radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys .  when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet .  he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals .  it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter .  but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china .  tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border .  the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays .  the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india .  the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do .  it just doesn't fit that mold .  if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) .  the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that .  the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa .  perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet .  a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie .  the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold .  the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans .  even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet .  philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice .  for those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala .  his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns .  these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition .  people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music .  it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person .  on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .

"the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode .  after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine .  after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world .  again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it .  the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' .  someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake .  that someone is death .  you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . .  but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve .  for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport .  alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air .  in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft .  after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky .  the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize .  but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances .  the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi .  before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . .  is that one helluva premise , or what ?  `final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong .  on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that .  unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool .  you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks .  young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' .  after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' .  low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent .  some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 .  `final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years .  not that the characters are that good .  sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend .  in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) .  aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) .  the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! '  toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . .  `spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments .  not so .  `final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening .  the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick .  the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' ) .  but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes .  creative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise .  what will trigger the accident ?  will it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high' ?   ( yeah , sick humor ) .  will it be the leaking toilet ?  the falling fishing reel in the corner ?  the murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward .  a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach .  it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ?  it's fun .  in that simple regard , `final destination' is my cup of tea .  this stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side .  after the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you .  when will your ? design' expire ?  is death waiting around the corner ?  the `final' effect is a major case of the heebie-jeebies .

"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet .  i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online .  and i wonder : is that so bad ?  well , the commercial part is .  as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay .  to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act .  they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious .  tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ?  meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act .  she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) .  but , i like her best when she's , well , perky .  she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime .  some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know .  all i know is that i just like them both .  they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try .  they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming .  hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle .  here , the setup is a little different .  kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her .  she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) .  she is also having an affair , of sorts .  you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 .  they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is .  ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) .  fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly .  every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! "" .  it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have .  it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness .  this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love .  hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness .  you know it's going to happen , the question is now ?  thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids .  it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good .  hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is .  he is , i believe , america's greatest actor .  does he show it here ?  nah .  but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan .  which is what this movie boils down to .  it's pure confection .  all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet .  there are some immense flaws , like pacing .  the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow .  once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow .  i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour .  the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated .  e-mail ?  when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using .  but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history .  they just work together , and it's nice to see .  it gives you , well , a smile .  the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake .  i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was .  i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed .  you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate .  movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that .  i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night .  and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had .  hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world .  he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment .  tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie .  it's a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist .  it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .

"synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure .  everyone else around him has similar symptoms .  lester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain .  his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans .  and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living .  the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father .  when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family .  will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ?  opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone .  likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it .  sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world .  the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty .  american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie .  the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum .  the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is .  if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .

"`strange days' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles .  as the locals gear up for the new millenium , lenny nero ( ralph fiennes ) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips .  he pines for his ex-girlfriend , faith ( juliette lewis ) , not noticing that another friend , mace ( angela bassett ) really cares for him .  this film features good performances , impressive film-making technique and breath-taking crowd scenes .  director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it .  but as a whole , this is an unsatisfying movie .  the problem is that the writers , james cameron and jay cocks , were too ambitious , aiming for a film with social relevance , thrills , and drama .  not that ambitious film-making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals , it fails badly and obviously .  the film just ends up preachy , unexciting and uninvolving .

"the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings .  involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done .  he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own .  marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel .  hank's reaction is one of amusement .  he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how .  the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she's fantasizing about a fictious world where she'd rather be .  typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered .  the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable .  from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama .  carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all .  the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum .  after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat .  carly openly flirts with the co . hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool .  arguments ensue .  the family becomes even more alienated .  the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb .  back at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father can't deal with their mother's problems .  one daughter says , "" he's blind and she's crazy . ""  the other answers , "" they're perfect for each other . ""  it reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co's son ( o'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed .  she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open .  hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co's wife ( snodgress ) .  he confronts the c . o .  but not about carly .  he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing .  a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife .  hank is arrested .  what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co . he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation .  instead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope .  he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters .  carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time .  the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems .  the performances are solid throughout .  jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife's rage .  he comforts her and offers protection .  lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family .  amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should .  blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family .  the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) .  the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 .  he had made such classics as look back in anger ( 1958 ) and tom jones ( 1963 ) .  orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years .  the film joins an alread promising fall line-up of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone .

"susan granger's review of "" hearts in atlantis "" ( castle rock/warner bros . )  timing is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of "" stand by me "" with the mystical power of "" the green mile . ""  based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it's set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self-centered mother ( hope davis ) .  he's devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card .  knowing he's longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers .  the story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive .  the only explanation is that he's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now .  the production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" hearts in atlantis "" is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis .

"in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon .  in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it .  gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll .  mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt .  so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors .  but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy .  to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat .  his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back .  payback is often a very violent film .  to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films .  the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot .  when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot .  so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end .  it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities .  in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities .  but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him .  my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive .  gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job .  he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance .  this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) .  the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) .  if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role .  in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work .

"the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid's point of view is , in a word , "" dark "" .  you wouldn't expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson's novel , but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal .  jekyll/hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate .  mary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman sentiment of the times .  director stephen fears' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them .  the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie : it almost appears to be filmed in black and white .  the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid .  scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry .   ( except there's no red , of course . )  the look is so moody and melodramatic that you'll be shocked when you leave the theater .  i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward .  often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts .  here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless .  his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience .  two parts that make up a whole .  neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable .  the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude .  when we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands .  roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles .  both are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film .  the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents .  life and color maybe , but this is not close's best role .  she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character .  a beautiful film in its own dreary way .  you'll appreciate the filmmaking craft , but don't expect to leave in an upbeat mood .

"harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt ) .  when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory .  my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you ) .  the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that .  arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion .  many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the "" silly factor "" of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it .  one casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ?  please . . .  if rose mcgowan is sexy then i'm marilyn manson .  given the current state of the actual wcw , if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming , he'd be the most popular guy they have .  on a similar note , the "" plot line "" of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years .  although one does have to ask . . .  why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ?  director brian robbins ( you'll remember him as eric from tv's "" head of the class "" ) just knows how to make good dumb movies .  this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues .  and screenwriter steven brill ( the epic mighty ducks trilogy , late last night ) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time , with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me .  the only exceptions to that were : 1 ) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 ) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan .  those moments made me cringe and/or groan .  as an added bonus though , the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll .

"albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time .  with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way .  while this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor .  in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say .  in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past .  he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career .  so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment .  the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end .  it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ?  the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner .  speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter .  every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing .  albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character .  the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone .  she wasn't likeable at all .  brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through .  in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak .  luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap .  it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because "" the muse "" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy .  on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife .  she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in .  the funniest moments in "" the muse "" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese .  i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary .  it was just plain hilarious .  it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas .  brilliant move by brooks .  as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before .  unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood .   "" bowfinger "" had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but "" the muse "" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour .  by the end of the film , you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it .  for once i'm not fully disappointed , because the film didn't slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws .  thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort .  i think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future .

"as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d-day , the weary , seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat .  they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen .  one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck .  as the flap falls , the battle begins .  they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire .  amid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler's list .  a soldier , clearly missing an arm , wanders around the body-strewn beach like a lost puppy .  we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself .  he bends over , picks up his arm and starts to carry it , probably not bothering to ask himself ; "" what now ? ""  saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film .  the direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar .  the cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding .  but be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen .  the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get .  the question is , "" does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? ""  the answer from my point of view is "" no "" .  braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film .  ryan is ten times worse .  expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield .  many in the theater could not bear to watch .  and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year .  but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) .  saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film's primary mission .  captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield .  the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan doesn't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice .  miller's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they don't yet know him .  they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn't have any more or less right to live than any of them .  this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end .  the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it's own .  spielberg , though not a student of the "" quick cut "" school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it .  bay should pay close attention , take copious notes .  if you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan .  in the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the "" importance "" of the film .  schindler's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust .  it opened eyes , sparked debate and study .  though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they don't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler's list .  overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , "" war is hell . ""  but braveheart-dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again .  masterful work marred only by excessive gore .

"who would have thought ?  jim carrey does drama .  when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! ""  however , it was an even better premise for a drama .  the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man .  that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) .  truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way .  christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world .  he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles .  there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal .  the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world .  we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past .  it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start .  the film can be described in one word : weird .  it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did .  it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it .  jim carrey actually lived up to the hype .  the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama .  no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey .  and he showed them all up .  jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .  i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination .  he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world .  he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening .  he ventures into the wrong elevator .  a light crashes in front of him .  his father comes back and is then pulled away .  we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not .  and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish .  carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama .  laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife .  she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point .  peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape .  the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down .  despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" god "" of truman's world .  he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created .  he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life .  the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish .  but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show .  it really makes you think .  maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show .  some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking .  or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival .  and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line .  all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative .  i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it .  overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood .  jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best .  andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .  the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .

""  don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist .  setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors .  when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute .  he's an equal opportunity bigot .  he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe .  melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him .  and she's none too happy about it .  when carol doesn't show up for work , melvin's routine is shot and he's determined to do something about it .  tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast .  the fact that she's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn't appear to phase him , he wants his food .  much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery .  this doesn't upset melvin much ( "" don't worry , you'll be back on your knees in no time "" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon's dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey .  melvin is sequestered because he's afraid of what's out there on the other side of his apartment door .  he has to make sure it's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side .  when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes .  this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up .  hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son .  he even develops a friendship with simon .  all three people are heavily damaged .  melvin has retreated from life in his apartment .  carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him .  simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out .  a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you'd rarely see .  and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments .  melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice .   "" you make me want to be a better man , "" he tells her .  one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon .  carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him .  it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest .  there's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson .  i don't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment .  nicholson may be the best actor working today .  hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson's energy .  she isn't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch .  their on-screen chemistry is a bit odd .  each does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there's something a little off .  it's a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film .  director james l . brooks ( "" terms of endearment "" , "" broadcast news "" ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands .

"the question isn't why has grease been reissued .  the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .  no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ?  the answer is not an easy one .  grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era .  the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited .  travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening .  but grease didn't break any new cinematic ground .  it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider .  what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history .  ok , let's not be a spoilsport .  grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers .  it's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career .  he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly .  cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur .  between grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand .  two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .  today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .  today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .  secondly , a lack of talent .  performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .  most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .  a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world .  he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles .  so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose .  if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals .  perhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years .  at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna .  so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals .  let grease be the word that sparks this revival .

"now , lets first look into the history of shark films .  there was the unforgettable jaws .  the exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) .  now , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones !  russell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease .  the substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones .  as sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure .  with the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days .  gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after .  this time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all .  so-so acting , expected in most of your average action film .  jackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines .  ll cool j's cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal's cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films .  deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer .  it does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not  humour !  its like jurassic park under water .  nothing too stressful , pure entertainment .  renny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) .

"robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style .  the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force .  1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike .  to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city .  on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one .   ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . )  after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i .  recruits his remains for their new "" robocop "" program .  using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal .  the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i .  engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) .  with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i .  envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems .  the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers .  as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective .  dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects .  several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics .  because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater .  although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre .  rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society .  the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors .  these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore .  the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood .  1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society .  the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd .  verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary .  unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre .  the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens .  robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character .  we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot .  does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ?  the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action .  moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine .  robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends .  as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before .  in many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish .  however , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off .

"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings .  a prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school .  less successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york .  now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies .  like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player .  julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution .  josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion .  o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy .  the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ?  - and written by brad kaaya , is very grim .  an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits .  and that is how it should be .  of all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery .  kaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts .  the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin .  plus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood .  the script follows the familiar lines of the classic .  hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game .  it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved .  the performances in o vary .  phifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease .  he also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system .  hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover .  stiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight .  the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging .  also desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling .  why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back .  it is irrational .  but these are minor carpings .  overall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation .  if nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature .

"gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit .  in fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years .  without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated .   "" the gift , "" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond .  it's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions .  the film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other .  annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown .  some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father .  for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future .  her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that .  when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to .  but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about .  at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) .  soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home .   "" the gift "" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's "" for love of the game "" ) lift the picture up several notches .  slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery .  at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's "" the talented mr . ripley "" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her .  blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had .  we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress .  blanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year .  in her first role following her oscar win for 1999's "" boys don't cry , "" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie .  as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's "" the watcher "" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all .  for the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given .  giovanni ribisi ( 2000's "" the boiler room "" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad .  in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's "" wonder boys "" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn .  her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes .  finally , kim dickens ( 2000's "" hollow man "" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda .  the other notable aspect of "" the gift "" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating .  thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread .  helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , "" the gift "" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too .  it may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time .

""  everything else pales in comparison .   "" good will hunting "" exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling , but , unlike "" little man tate "" or "" phenomenon "" , it doesn't set up its story in a black and white , point a to point b be manner , but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy , familiar choices , like the protagonists in the aforementioned .

"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece .  when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure .  for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed .  and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece .  more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right .   "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced .   "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off .  having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status .  a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city .  in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original .   "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail .  most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film .  not "" babe : pig in the city "" .  this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first .  also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy .  in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself .  instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own .  and it succeeds .  that's not to say the familiar is absent .   "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film .  along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) .  the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals .  the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice .  from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative .  composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these .  but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting .  while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals .  monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter .  each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching .  and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well .  mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors .  stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature .  we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions .  not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was .  so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here .  it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance .  the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction .  simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level .  restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture .  but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks .  designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) .  added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers .  the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold .  it is a world that you want to walk around in .  norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape .  most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit .  andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones .  much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city "" .  reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating .  these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating .  but even so , to be anything harsher than the original' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms .  by deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating .  although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself .  well , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" 's death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated .  granted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be .  whatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo's oil "" ) .  having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise .  the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original .  missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life .   "" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable .   "" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones .  this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on .  but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive .   "" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe .  hoggett's love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality .  best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique .  it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not .  please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a great one .  but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best .  as an overall piece , "" babe : pig in the city "" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end .  sure , it isn't a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness .  it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation .   "" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema .  as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year's best cinematic treats .

"alchemy is steeped in shades of blue .  kieslowski's blue , that is .  with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release .  language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length .  as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant .  alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" .  while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) .  when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her .  following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil .  events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability .  in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult .  alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues .  in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art .  does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ?  are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ?  myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context .  through louisa's struggles , she succeeds .  while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination .  even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention .  the cinematography is stunning .  city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions .  later , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground .  it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability .  the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul .  and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace .  her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal .  even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch .  alchemy isn't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it's close .

"billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment .  as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers .  three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money .  jacob and lou want to pocket the cash .  hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find .  eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways .  things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan .  disaster is sure to strike .  director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name .  while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come .  scott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension .  while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter .  alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character .  danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score .  if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long .  just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further .  while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) .  the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife .  this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films .  fingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel .

"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something .  it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up .  it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film .  having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about .  does men live up to its press ?  well , yes it does .  and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .  for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment .  chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business .  chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder .  howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent .  we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .  there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her .  the reason ?  both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex .   "" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says .  howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan .  they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp .  chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner .  howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate .  flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both .  you can guess which one she falls for .  soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him .  adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ?  in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls .  his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile .  we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart .  his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him .  he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .  if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind .  politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground .  men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory .  the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe .  the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .  could it happen in the real world ?  probably not .  taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society .  maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience .  the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .  the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .  but does the film work as entertainment ?  its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions .  it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers .  stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her .  likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions .  by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .  certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .  but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time .  like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world .  while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs .  there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .

"there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last .  george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy .  return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films .  the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone .  instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears .  even darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around .  with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman .  return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back .  luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine .  their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt .  it is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play .  from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch .  as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor .  so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks .  there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader .  return of the jedi has some interesting elements .  the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted .  from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films .  not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved .  on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects .  in the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch .  the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films .  by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas .  the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific .  as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for .  newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars .  although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment .  with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang .  congratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come .   ,  ",1
"dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station .  she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states .  she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts .  she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring .  totally trustworthy , right ?  not a chance .  once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) .  one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father .  shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned .  days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament .  through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father .  this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace .  films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films .  it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own .  it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly .  and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that .  the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental .  the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film .  dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals .  but neither side is trivialized .  she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially .  fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? .  he , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states .  he is a natural , and never once grating .  send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas .

"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more .  although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater .  so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes .  although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie .  quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen .  the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema .  not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough .  kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture .  it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . ""  maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times .  it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like .  soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness .  at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t .  walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town .  fine performances are turned in all around .  maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t .  walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) .  daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy .  for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career .  also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish .  there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't .

""  it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept .  the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art .  arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema .   ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . )  granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "" purpose "" of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing .  the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions .  and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion .  _pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression .  a brief introduction to pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush .  in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , "" you paint the fucking thing , "" and leaves in a huff .  by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision .   ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . )  such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does .  while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock's conniptions too many : "" you are killing me !  you are killing me !  you are killing me ! ""   ( aside : harris' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . )  pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth .  i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well .  it's scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal's hummable but no less lamentable score--i can't imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images .  one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break .  a more seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal .

""  with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life .  lester works for an advertising agency .  his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering .  estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress .  his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy .  carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker .  she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings .  but inside she is desperate .  unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family .  the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter .  a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction .  this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple .  not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her .  some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters .  most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts .  she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one .  colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man .  his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's .  in fact they are the next door neighbors .  anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty "" .  alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years .  not one character in this film rings falsely .  and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful .  the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" .  kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances .  his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age .  finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth .  he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet .  mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees .  annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career .  carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy .  unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder .  ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone .  the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words .  thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her .  jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment .  her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning .  she is the prototypical trophy child .  when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i'm so proud of you , honey .  you didn't screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable .  thora birch is a young actress to watch .  praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance .  colonel finn is a man in complete denial .  his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend .  wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma .  the boy next door who may be more foe than friend .  a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him .  mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film .  that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it .  director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle .  scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character .  the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) .  every nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it's audience to think and examine .  it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come .  and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best .

""  that film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson's tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that'll make you laugh out loud .  witness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company .  that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in "" highway 61 . ""  what's also charming about "" i went down "" is how the relationship between buddy and git develops .  their trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it's handled is neither sappy nor labored .  the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom .  it's a little too hollywood , and what makes "" i went down "" so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies .  sure it's gritty--make that grubby--but it's also pretty goofy .  although "" i went down "" emphasizes the comedic elements of dis-organized crime , there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter .  don't let these deter you , though ; "" i went down "" is a little gem .  it's only playing at one philadelphia-area theater--and i suspect it won't be there for long--so catch it while you can .

"[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap .  as it happens , it didn't take long . ]  is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ?  known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria .  last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature .  it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen .  at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance .  the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused .  the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery .  the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus .  it is zeffirelli's genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace .  in this italian master's hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son's worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea .  after all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ?  what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead .  who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a "" lethal weapon "" ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ?  franco zeffirelli , that's who .  and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money .  what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible .  his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed .  his movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character .  this is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film's end .  glenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet's mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i'm still trying to understand the character as written .   ( zeffirelli's incestuous interpretation of hamlet's relationship with his mother doesn't help . )  alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy .  by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably .  of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone .  both support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare "" this is important ; this is shakespeare ! ""  i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due .  perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare "" definitive . ""  and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen .  but if you've ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start .

"he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother .  she inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus .  he has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases .  he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door .  he is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit .  he is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears .  his father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion .  unsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way "" his "" boy has turned out .  he is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts .  soon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest .  bubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable .  the father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom .  bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind .  so far , so good .  the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant .  the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe .  it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins .  it is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes .  he observes what it might be like .  the intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack .  for thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own .  then de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers .  our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives .  he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) .   .   .  it goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once .  de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again .  the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby's experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother's walls , bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel .  the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby's mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him .  although de heer's touch is at times overbearing , bubby's salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope .  a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community .  he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw .  innocence triumphs .  bubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom .  it's a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn't be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain't like other movies .

"the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily .  three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making .  they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house .  from there , things become a little more complicated .  i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me .  although i know it was all a staged "" mockumentary "" , there's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you .  i didn't feel much upon initially watching it .  i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts .  i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend .  i've gotten chills every time i've brought it up since then .  this is not a movie that hits you right away .  instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it's way up into your mind .  this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch .  the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work .  this is as real as it gets folks .  i don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera .  the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not .  this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera .  the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen .  word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release .  i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd's .  i know i'll be first in line to buy one .

"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film .  with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa .  attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs .  i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology .  as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master .  as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality .  crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category .  crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology .  it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable .  all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement .  the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two .  it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend .  the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented .  the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively .  the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake .  there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry .  as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy .  do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed .  for those who are put off by the "" art "" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance .  there are no weak performances in this movie .  michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom .  chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart .  zhang ziyi is a budding superstar .  she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role .  cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably .  kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film .  ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit .  this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies .  don't miss it .

"reflecting on "" bedazzled , "" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind .  if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way .  with her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation .  it's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down .  her next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please .  to aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring "" steve the copy guy "" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills .  eugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way .  yet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf .  he wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him .  however , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell .   "" dear god , "" he prays .   "" i would give anything to have that girl in my life . ""  guess who then shows up ?  she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse .   "" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . ""  there's even an escape clause .  if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over .  the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love .  but when he makes sweeping statements such as "" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison "" , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details .  for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else .  apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul .  his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life .  soon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal .  given the mischievous nature of the devil , "" bedazzled "" has many amusing moments .  a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance .  he ably assumes various personas .  his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world .  allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her .  hurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one .  it's clear that she's having a good time with it all .  yet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story .  but that would be playing with fire .  what they've got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is .

"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) .  of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were .  however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series .  in short , i had a good time .   "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one .  of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) .  so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) .  so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her .  once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay .  also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) .  there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough .  oh well .  well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship .  and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth .  of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun .  the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) .  what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach .   "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights .   "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller .   "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir .   "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares .  jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat .  the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning ) .  and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that .  this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others .  there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed .  one is the aforementioned surgery scene .  another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome .  the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" ) .  and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) .  but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) .  it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga .  the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters .  however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared .  and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! ""  johner : "" well , i can get you off .  but not this ship . "" )  the acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him .  winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) .  of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show .  playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable .  she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens , "" but she's just awesome .  overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment .  the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply .  but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series .

"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds .  that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) .  but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way .  the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays .  four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse .  the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty .  kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve .  he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him .  the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle .  the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin .  nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back .  the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night .  on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again .  that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport .  in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him .  it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children .  first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class .  they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child .  meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true .  he's finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true .  he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box .  slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane .  he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" ) .  he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring .  the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house .  macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor .  still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing .  for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car .  kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa .  he learned how to deal with the furnace .  you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore .  he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man .  they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid .  finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) .  this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert .  it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie .  on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie .  john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings .  but it does have its flaws .  the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well .  as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character .  the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times .  instead of "" i'm gonna get that kid "" they say "" i'm gonna kill that kid . ""  some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree .  mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas .  i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year .  don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick .

"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal .  a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another .  a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain .  a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end .  if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues .  it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label .  edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states .  you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines .  arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack .  however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal .  in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world .  unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza .  while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information .  generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm .  even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country .  hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government .  the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . ""  however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare .  revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america .  admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid .  i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order .  it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself .  in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk .  although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups .  throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully .  what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides .  it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience .  i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great .  this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable .  annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable .  it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range .  bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face .  however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development .  notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant .  the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society .  difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch .  perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night .  whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer .  i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most .  revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole .  it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year .  missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes .  for example , it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick .  unfortunately , there's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching .  in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops .  verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point .  the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along .  a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously .  these flaws are glaring , but they don't detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class .

"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies .  i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven .  was it any good ?  well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) .  now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker .  i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection .  problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail .  so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ?  truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches .  yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from .  as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos .  as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring .  now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ?  ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain .  throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! )  into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city .  how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ?  so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved .  the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at .  since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't .   ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) .  like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have .   ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) .  here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) .  williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york .  they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes .  and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done .  the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice .  danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way .  he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent "" .  he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners .  right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do .  and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be .  undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) .  how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ?  prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat .  lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action .  his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking .  lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension .  this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching .  though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot .  some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic .  hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable .  of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on .  for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills .  it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies .  there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing .  this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak .  in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out .  he's lost his voice .  does that little itty bitty detail matter ?  maybe not to most , but it sure made my night .  and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .

"i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba's oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- "" memories of underdevelopment "" .  i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition .  i knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit .  fellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs .  i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain't so .  having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness , i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement .  as kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution's current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident .  the proper questions to put relate to castro's legitimacy .  i bet the film takes castro's power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba's state control , cannot question his right to run cuba's political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) .  that's why i just can't believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime .  let's see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up .  i saw the film--twice .  i was right ; castro remained intact .  strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young "" dialectic materialist , "" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba .  the young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution's reason for being .  grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty .  therein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians .  cuba's government is castro .  diego's lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life .  he enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art .  he does not do "" voluntary work "" for the revolution .  his small apartment is a sensual oasis .  the moniker "" bourgeois "" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie .  however , he is a "" revolucionario "" in his own way .  the supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david's roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david's ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government .  gutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too .  heck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor .  he really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws .  real criticism is missing though .  this movie is political window dressing .  luis aguilar leon's op .  ed .  piece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition .  aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film's political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment .  as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept "" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . ""  although terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film .  ",1
" "" a breed apart "" casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner .  a bit hard to swallow ?  that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film .  hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector .  turner is the woman caught between the two men .   "" a breed apart "" isn't a bad movie , exactly .  indeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different .  the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies .  for example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at "" his "" birds .  later on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them .  i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn't get involved at that point .  another problem is the silly love-triangle that develops .  i didn't care one way or the other who ended up with turner .  i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions .  however , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there's more to life than money and birds .  as for hauer , he's an actor i've always admired .  he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters .  and this one is no exception .  he's frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate's clothing , and holstering a cross-bow .  despite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through .  for example , there's a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early .  he comes off as crazy loner in that scene , but a few minutes later , he is apologizing to turner , and we believe his intentions .  soon after , we find out he's a vietnam vet , and his actions become fairly clear to us .   "" a breed apart "" isn't a great movie by any means , but it does contain good performances by all three leads , and it's worth seeing for that reason alone .  ",1
"ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really .  it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) .  in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians .  these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) .  this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well ,  you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) .  moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) .  in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) .  this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think .  after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) .  movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too "" big "" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle .  maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) .  the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) .  in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's "" kids in the hall "" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story .  unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well ,  you'll see .  the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots .  one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka .  another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw .  and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint .  of course , the movie does have its share of silliness .  for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head .  in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become .  but what has he become ?  a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ?  doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre .  but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly .  so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films .  while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics .  but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left .  although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think .  i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign .  go see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  dr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don't hold this against him .

"when i saw the trailer for "" the sixth sense , "" i didn't expect much from it .  my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "" the shining "" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago .  but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot .  it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year .  bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe .  at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) .  a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed .  cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called "" freak "" by the other boys in the neighborhood .  weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school .  he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom .  the trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist .  if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole .  if you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see "" the sixth sense . ""  anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here .  once malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere .  dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole .  malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth .  the box office success of "" the sixth sense "" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so .  i hate to burst anybody's bubble , but "" the sixth sense "" isn't really a horror film .  at its core , "" the sixth sense "" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems .  some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though .  one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , "" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun "" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head .  osment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor .  it's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal !  although willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life .  if only willis' work were as impressive .  accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date .   ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , "" the story of us , "" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) .  writer/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite .  he's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates .  only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie .  look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole .  bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .

"is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ?  i was almost stunned by the quality of "" who framed roger rabbit ? "" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together .   "" the little mermaid "" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century .  however , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be's is getting to me .  you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke .  it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome .  that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio .  from what i've seen of their movies ( "" kiki's delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat .  these movies , particularly "" kiki's delivery service , "" are wonderfully original and entertaining .   "" kiki's delivery service "" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home .  this is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch .  her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance .  just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom .  kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to .  initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch .  on the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it .  the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service .  this is where the movie becomes shockingly good .  kiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her .  the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light .  they're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl .  however , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique .  the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's .  this beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at .  i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie .  some of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship .  in the garage of a deliveree's house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend .  such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg .  added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth .  kiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty .  this causes kiki to lose faith in herself .  however , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her .  seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it .  the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i've ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention .  the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes .  however , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian .  refreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into .   "" beauty and the beast "" 's beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person's inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing .  kiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film .  another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for "" kiki's delivery service "" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki's flights .  the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i've ever seen .  i'm not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states .  disney tentatively plans a theater release of "" monoko hime "" shortly following the summer '97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that .  i'd guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release .  although the wait is unfortunate , it's good to know that it's being released at all , for "" kiki's delivery service "" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release .  watch this movie .  along with "" man bites dog , "" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i've ever seen .

"8mm is not going to enlighten your day .  it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence .  not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well .  nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late .  he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality .  cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability .  at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of .  his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe .  the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered .  or so it seems .  welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth .  and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head .  he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography .  max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change .  the devil changes you . '  these turn out to be very wise words .  8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution .  the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her .  this is where everything goes awry .  although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula .  everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects .  although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control .  cage is the film's sole flame of energy .  his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation .  still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand .  welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry .  this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film .  he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie .  written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece .  furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ?  the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) .  this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side .

" * * the following review contains spoilers * *   "" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . ""  -- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal  i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin .  apparently , no one heard my words .  oh , how i wish you had heard them .  oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . .  because he's done it again .  the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale .  in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not .  in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government .  keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves .  he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well ) .  he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery .  after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe .  it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera .  the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film .  so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film .  the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless .  welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) .  when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing .  the choice of casting does the film in .  then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him .  the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet .  so your first instinct has now been confirmed .  then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments ) .  but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended .  huh ?  also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back .  so why did he give it up in the first place ? !  the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? !  it's totally absurd . . .  and this is the screenwriter of seven ?  late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car .  cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table .  james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense "" .  you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching .  go around to the other side of the car ! !  this goes on for minutes .  then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car .  boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves .  i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn !  we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard .  other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that .  whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it .  awful decision there joel .  another is cage's performance .  at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad .  for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) .  you're capable of much better mr . cage .  now as for you mr . schumacher . . .  i'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year .  earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs .  and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies .  starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend .  besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience .  at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber .  after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb .  with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making .  a timeless epic it is not .  besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands .  on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery .  there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) .  jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective .  jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard .  she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast .  jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost .  quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble .  the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions .  faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' .  all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful .  the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' .  there's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier .  even his fellow troopers are petrified .  `the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story .  almost too 90's , it seems .  there's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! '  sprinkled throughout the screenplay .  i was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened .  there's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly .  it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does .  the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive .  if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal .  but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake .  during these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning .  it's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects .  `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf .  anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film .  despite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy .

"the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film .  since june , i haven't been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha's "" take on me "" in his yellow miata .  why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ?  honestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie .  man , was i wrong .  corky romano is one of those throwaway , clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots .  fortunately for chris kattan's precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety .  kattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny '80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans ( "" you don't have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps . "" ) .  when his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges , his bungling , lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent , black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence .  predictably , hijinks ensue .  if the basic plot sounds bad , wait until you get into the inner-workings of this clunker .  the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity .  corky's fbi agent identity is named corky pissant ( "" that's pronounced pees-ahn .  it's french . "" ) .  he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom .  and not a good sitcom , i mean .  the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other's face .  and in a scene taken straight from there's something about mary , corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation .  but it's not a complete disaster .  the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments , including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren , a german shephard , and a kilo of cocaine .  plus , berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie .  and , it's nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work .  unfortunately for those out there who can't truly appreciate animal or fart jokes , corky won't have much to offer you .  so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv , asking , "" who is corky ? ""  you can simply reply , "" who cares ? ""  ",0
"adam sandler isn't known for appearing in deep , thought-provoking films , but he's still a really funny guy .  most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out .  big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler's comic performance , and it's a miserable failure .  sandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) .  as one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say "" good-bye "" to one another ; in addition , there's a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) .  there's a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny .

"" .  uhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ?  plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college .  when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman .  critique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks .  this movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles .  i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr .  zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate .  he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue .  sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs . tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! ) .  all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend .  no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater .  if you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning .  little known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson's father was a fisherman .  kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) .  he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv's "" dawson's creek "" , a show kevin created .  he was once an aspiring actor .  in fact , he even landed a bit part on tv's "" another world "" .  also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book "" killing mr . griffin "" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) ,  lois duncan .  he has also come out and said that he is a gay man .  helen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff .  she is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  this film was originally titled killing mrs .  tingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident .  actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called "" wasteland "" .  this is actor barry watson first full feature film .  he has played the character of "" seth "" on tv's "" malibu shores "" several times .

"movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain .  in the best of all possible worlds , they accomplish both .  on the red planet , they fail entirely .  in the near future , a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth .  this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be .  after some mumbo-jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet , the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does .  the ground crew of people you couldn't care less about is trapped on the surface without food , water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog .  the one potentially interesting character ( carrie-anne moss ) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer .  attempting to graft "" 2001 "" esque space mysticism with "" terminator "" robot horror , first time director antony hoffman can't seem to figure out what's going on .  neither can we .  didn't he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story ?  couldn't he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter ?  there are so many mis-steps .  every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction .  why introduce the theme of faith vs . science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ ?  the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen .  two hours later , they're still waiting .  despite our greatest hopes , there is no life on the red planet .

"some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch .  then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains .  the real mccoy is both .  it's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation .  the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job .  six years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight .  she soon bumps into j . t . barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen .  j . t . also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him .  schmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery .  this time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son .  just when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in . *  contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them .  leading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins .  there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in .  karen's initial encounter with j . t . during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility .  it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment .  small world , eh ?  then there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage .  however , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day .  but the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne .  there is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character .  karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material .  schmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture .  only kilmer's j . t . is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed .  in fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot .  i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast .  various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room floor .  even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes .  there is no tension in the scene , just tedium .  russell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room .  there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones .  like karen disarming one of schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing .  like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later .  tempted . but i'm pretty good at resisting temptation .

"cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success .  sadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close .  this time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops .  following several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the "" money train "" --a train which carries all the subway's takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there's * an original plot device ) , harrelson's character decides to try and take off with the cash .  along the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss .  this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( 'you were always the better brother' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn't help to add anything to the film .  given a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time .  robert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history !  he sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets !  but this is only one of money train's problems .  if you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense .  but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse .  the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain't butch and sundance .  the film isn't all bad though .  snipes and harrelson , when they aren't using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent .  but good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie .  if you're a really undemanding action freak , there's a chance you'll like this .  but if you're looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you'll find it here .

" "" the beach "" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder .  every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act .  it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment .  but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "" blue lagoon "" .  forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of "" lord of the flies "" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs .  by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about .  the main character of "" the beach "" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) .  he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time .  richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown .  this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for .  he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) .  he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis .  though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen .  moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life .  captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey .  they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's .  once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise .  this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard .  etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand .  it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view .  and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers .  for example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards .  and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark .  there are several ideas that are introduced in "" the beach "" and each one could merit its own feature-length film .  there's the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle .  but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred .  dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through .  consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up .

"except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through .  bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan , actress and author , once married , now violently divorced , and back together one last time for their daughter molly's ( paula marshall ) wedding .  lilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again .  each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other .  molly , married now only 24 hours , runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith ( jamie denton ) tries to console the abandoned spouses .  in molly's search for her parents , she somehow falls in love with lilly's paparazzo joey ( danny nucci ) .  meanwhile , the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan's wife rowena ( gail o'grady ) in bed .  the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious .  i'm no dan quayle , but i thought it was a bit creepy .  the message seemed to be "" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish . ""   "" family values "" aside , there's something cruel about all this .  perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy , but the movie is a romantic comedy .  we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps .  reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable .  lilly's husband is a new-age flake who rambles about "" emotional valet parking , "" so we can write him off as irrelevant .  dan's wife is vain , manipulative , and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch .  molly's husband is a career-conscious , self-centered republican politician who thinks she's too fat ( and just for good measure , he also fucked dan's wife ) , so we can write him off as a prick .  everyone else falls in love .  but still , that somehow doesn't justify the actions of the movie's main characters .   "" he's a prick "" or "" she's a bitch "" is no defense .  the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated arguments -- and by above-average performances by midler and farina ( breaking out of his character-actor mold ) .  other than that , it's a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick .

""  the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky , and does who knows what with it .  and then there's mitch and sam , who , thinking they can get $50000 by destroying a building , ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents .   "" too bad we have to do it , "" mitch says .  here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used .  at least the film is honest , and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic .  but at least it isn't dull , and it isn't predictable .  and that's the way it should be .  it's sketch comedy , and if you're a fan of norm macdonald , you'll love it .  the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care .  if you don't like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won't like this one .  the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care .  so before seeing this one , tune your mindset , and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor , gay animal sex , prison rape jokes , uncaring characters , and one last performance from chris farley .  the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) .  i just couldn't stop laughing .

"well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you .  because thats all that there really is . . . .  i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot .  for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity . . . .  i am not saying that this isn't possible . .  but it does leave one to wonder . . . i  know i did .  another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out . . . .  and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations .  there was one scene that should have been short . . .  but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking . .  ok enough already get on with it .  there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do . . .  things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort . . .  another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning .  this movie is also very predictable . . .  you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment . .  granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you .  also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated . . .  it gets boring at times to tell you the truth . . .  even though there is still action going on .  another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero .  some of the characters are not proper for their roles .  the acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up .  if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done .  the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie .  the special effects are just amazing , you can't tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during filming , extinct or not .  another thing is the destruction scenes . . .  wow , those were masterpieces . .  well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie .  this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office . .  unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do . .  i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments . .  go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me .  one little side note , although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid , there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly . . . .  and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance . . . .  you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made . . . . .  i thought i'd put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick . . .  its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this .

"in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don't cut it .  sleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess .  for those who remember disney's fantastic "" adventures of ichabod crane "" , it is actually superior to this .  disney's version was at least interesting , while burton's film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights .  while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off .  ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders .  the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman .  now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow .  sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster .  in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable .  no one could stop him , not even ichabod .  by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought .  burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes .  he takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails .  another pathetic element of the film was the script .  like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims .  he completely butchered the story to pieces .  thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked .  the acting by depp was quite notable .  he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner .  if it wasn't for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy .  just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this .  it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster .  it's too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush .  the atmosphere too was quite involving .  i should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on .  at least burton's films are eye candy , even if they are trash .  the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien .  other than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery .  by the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed .  this is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this .  don't waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow .

"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality .  he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict .  but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation .  a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category .  the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york .  during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed .  in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community .  emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder .  concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover .  that isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways .  things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) .  using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film .  even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent .  but the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith .  the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles .  role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them .  first of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better .  screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) .  but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community .  also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture .  that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .

"the happy bastard's quick movie review  the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really .  shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control .  sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber .  since the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem .  the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world .  his popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground .  then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything .  these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine .  forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while .  however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm .  with the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada .  of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish .  this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow .  finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) .  the main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny .  in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) .  but that's just it- scenes .  there's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend .  i mean , was this really necessary ?  couldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ?  i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ?  particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ?  that really ruined it , however , and that's too bad .  the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting .  still , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ?  at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked .

"i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad , there would be broken furniture , traces of smack and cocaine on the floor , and a dead prostitute in the bathroom .  i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad , there might be the same elements present .  coincidence ?  poor kyle ( a meek looking jon favreau ) . . . he is about to marry his radiant fiancee , laura ( cameron diaz ) .  but before he exchanges his vows , he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout .  but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get .  the prostitute has met a horrible , though accidental death , and drugs are everywhere .  the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time .  a surprisingly calm robert boyd ( christian slater ) , who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions , ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she'll never be found .  although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body ( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases ) , when they return from their trip , guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends .  one is adam ( daniel stern ) he grows increasingly agitated .  whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way , his blood pressure increases .  or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family .  another is michael , who was actually responsible for her death .  he tries to bury his feelings , but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well .  boyd is the ? doer' of the group .  seemingly suffering from a long psychosis , when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed , he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks .  kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura's demanding expectations .  then , there's moore ( leland orser ) who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face .  the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy , but it presents things in a manner that just aren't funny .  drugs , mutilation , and killing your own friends isn't something to be laughed at .  as a straight psychological drama , i could see how it might have worked , as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick ways .  but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours .  if you do like this movie , i don't think that i want to know you .  i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the ? smart play . '  and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding-needing fiancee .  but her talents are essentially wasted here .  it's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone .  but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless .  do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film .

" "" you damn dirty apes ! ""  that's just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that's taken on a comedic context over time .  no one back then seemed to realize how over-the- top charlton heston's acting style was , but it shows now , particularly in this "" mystery science theater 3000 "" wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time , actually winning one oscar ( for makeup , no less ) and being nominated for a couple others .  it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes , escape from the planet of the apes , return of the planet of the apes , beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes , planet of the apes : the next generation , police academy of the apes . . .  the list goes on .  heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth .  the thing is , on this planet humans can't talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species .  heston's companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned .  he surprises them all with his gift of speech , making two primate scientists ( roddy mcdowall and kim hunter ) believe heston is the missing link between ape and man .  believe me , we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years .  when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans ) , it is received as heresy , for all good monkeys know god "" created ape in his image . ""  but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species , before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president .  and he takes them there , holding up a baby doll and yelling , "" if humans couldn't speak , then how do you account for this talking doll ? ! ""  and how do you account for your acting ability , mr . heston ?  the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie's surprise conclusion .  i won't reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling "" god damn you all to hell ! ""  several times in succession .  the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them .  what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony , a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution .  but let me tell you , if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges ( heston [to female ape] : may i kiss you before i go ?  ape : but . . .  you're so . . .  ugly . ) , he'd convert to creationism on the spot .  luckily for us , science-fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good .

"the year is barely a week old , and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997--the relic , a would-be chiller that's more successful at making the audience laugh than scream .  in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams ( whose last two pictures were dreadful jean-claude van damme vehicles ) , a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses ( hypothalamii ? ) of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum .  how did this creature come into existence , and why does it feed on hormones ?  the "" scientific "" explanation cooked up by the four--yes , four--credited screenwriters ( amy holden jones , john raffo , rick jaffa , and amanda silver ) takes "" suspension of disbelief "" to new heights , even by monster movie standards .  but as cockamamie as the science is in the film , it isn't quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics .  miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination , turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip , complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears .  give it up , penelope--it's a _monster_movie_ .  on the flip side , tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant , but his role is so thankless that it's hard to imagine it being played any more effectively .  it's quite funny to see a film indulge , with the straightest of faces , in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream .  for example , in one early scene , a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night .  ok , we all know what's coming , but as if we didn't need any more confirmation , he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away .  everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie .  and later , miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing .  does she make a beeline for the front door ?  of course not--she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall .  with all the cliches , it is only fitting the film's climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film : that of someone outrunning a fireball .  if the relic is truly "" the next evolution in terror "" as the poster states , then the horror film--and humanity--is in even worse shape than we thought .

"sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime , but this has got to be one of the worst .  a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting , "" the specialist "" is about as exciting as an episode of "" dragnet , "" and about as well acted .  even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script , stupid and unlikable characters , and just plain nothingness .  who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ?  unless you saw "" blown away "" . . .   "" the specliast "" of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job .  his credo is killing bad people , not innocents .  and that's why he makes big bombs .  so anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc ) .  turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young .  so she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e-mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked .  yea .  also into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly .  using the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must-be-improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open .  these are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film .  the film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake-eyes .  it's just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time .  and for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic-looking special effects ( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub ) .  then there's the much-discussed sex scene between sly and stone , which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on "" friends .

"in the year 2029 , captain leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , "" boogie nights "" ) is training 'his' chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station .  when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles' pod is lost , davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the "" planet of the apes . ""  maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr . ( "" cast away "" ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( "" mighty joe young "" ) .  director tim burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake .  davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins .  however , he's rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , "" duets "" ) .  ari ( helena bonham carter , "" fight club "" ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , "" titanic "" ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion .  she takes a liking to leo , who she deems 'unusual . '  general thade ( tim roth , "" lucky numbers "" ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race .  he's sweet on ari .  it's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes .  the much ballyhooed 'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down .  an attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , "" driven "" ) giving each other 'back off' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them .  the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton's squeeze , lisa marie ) .  guffaws will also likely greet charlton heston's cameo as thade's father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying .  the only real success of the 2001 "" planet of the apes "" is rick baker's makeup , and even that's an iffy affair .  no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work .  roth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade's right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers .  giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal .  tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even's he's undone by some obvious wire work .  bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing .  most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover .  the ape's city resembles a dank complex of tree houses .  the apes' military costumes ( colleen atwood , "" sleepy hollow "" ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka's work on coppola's "" dracula .

"whenever u . s . government starts meddling into other countries' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says "" look who's talking !  what have you done to the indians ? ""  however , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes .  hollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s .  those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus' discovery of america .  one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers .  the hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century .  when the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation .  however , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless .  with not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign .  general crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn't enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest .  instead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) .  together with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo .  geronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors .  so , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies .  almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people .  although such elements of john millius' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo .  to be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time .  instead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band .  to make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers .  the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo's life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood .  the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting .  wes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role .  contrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies .  while this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall .  even hill's directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s .  even his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic .  on the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic .  all in all , compared with some of the hollywood's examples of political correctness , this film isn't so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better .

"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music .  it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea .  however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged .  unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original .  the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended .  elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died .  as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together .  john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable .  first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) .  cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band .  next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band .  finally , there's buster ( j .  evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band .  the plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it  seems to be almost a clone of the original .  elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale .  the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role .  in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original .  remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ?  well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music .  there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat .  there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) .  there are plenty of recurring characters too .  in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy .  frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden .  as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy .  aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood .  john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack .  joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab .  and what's the deal with the orphan ?  it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film .  at least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role .  but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music .  and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) .  although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable .  to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances .  b . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there .  unfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot .  if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks .  it's a shame .  buy the soundtrack and avoid the film .  better yet , rewatch the original . . . you'll  have a much better time .

'28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings .  gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol .  for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end .  this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself .  her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes .  such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house .  this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab .  here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment .  most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party .  the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times .  it is a classic cautionary tale .  an echo .  a big , fat and expensive clich ? .  a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' .  director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review .  for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy .  jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness .  and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean .  isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ?  even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 .  it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously .  but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance .  that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story .   "" all you need to do is just say no "" , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century .  and that's how simple it is !  in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' .  as for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else .  for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' .  she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop .  dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters .  although intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect .  there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor .  the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better .  'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues .  so what's the point ?  in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level .  if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' .  under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost .

"synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn't look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court .  after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie .  comments : "" alan smithee "" directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled "" fatal bore "" or "" fatal crap "" .  if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by "" alan smithee , "" then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else .   "" alan smithee "" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad .  frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the "" alan smithee "" moniker for this film .  where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ?  let's start with the acting .  it's pretty bad .  amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material .  she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete .  her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke .  the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand .  christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm .  trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket .  if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here .  early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom .  outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film .  they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever .  fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills .  the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with .  this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault .  even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up .  so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale .  the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an "" erotic thriller "" .  a thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic .  i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something "" erotic , "" that he'd be happy after watching this fluff .  a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative ) .  on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through .  it's no wonder why she hated high school so much .  as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration .  i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students .  fatal charm won't charm anyone , unless there's someone that's charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers .  if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on .

"movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers .  occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called "" teenagers . ""  can't hardly wait , however , does not .  instead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to .  can't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation .  the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) .  i couldn't stand any of those characters .  whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming "" yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! "" ,  all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film .  apparently , can't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not funny .  in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour .  and when i say "" forced "" , i mean it .  they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange .  this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour .  for instance , can't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as "" i am a sex machine . ""  for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny .  if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny .

"after the recent animated debacles of , "" a rugrats movie , "" and "" a bug's life , "" i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks' other insect film from october , "" antz . ""  i hated that movie , and yet , it is so much better than these latest two excursions .   "" a bug's life , "" is the second animated insect film in the last two months , and i hoped for the best , considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar's last film , 1995's "" toy story , "" but in no way does , "" a bug's life , "" even remotely match up to that .  flik ( david foley ) , an ant , who along with his many comrades , has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest , only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers , led by hopper ( kevin spacey ) .  flik , however , feels all alone and unwanted in the world , especially after he accidentally loses all of their food , and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season's load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees .  banished from ant island , flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out , but through a misunderstanding , returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs , including a walking stick ( david hyde pierce ) , a dung beetle ( brad garrett ) , a gypsy moth ( madeline kahn ) , a male ladybug ( denis leary ) , and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) .   "" a bug's life , "" has one thing going for it .  only one thing .  with its glorious , bright colors , the computer-generated animation is a spectacle to look at .  the film itself , unfortunately , is a lifeless , unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of , "" toy story . ""  the characters in , "" a bug's life , "" are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality , other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one-liners .  the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes , and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout , and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time-filler .  after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year , i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them , but then i realized this is just not so .  i still adore almost all of the older disney films , and many of the newer ones , such as 1989's , "" the little mermaid , "" 1991's , "" beauty and the beast , "" 1993's , "" the nightmare before christmas , "" and yes , 1995's , "" toy story .

"synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) .  in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip .  under sonny's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he "" wipes his ass , "" throw tantrums , and scream for his "" god damned "" treats .  self centered , julian breaks a school classmate's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong .  meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform .  not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle .  opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior .  that's the essence of big daddy .  but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing .  movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below .  on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies .  then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment .  folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation .  to many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's "" ice cold tits .

"there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story .  but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought .  for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction .  our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be .  brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy "" .  regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well .  his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing .  true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins .  the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily .  the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors .  the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino .  more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively .  donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious .  lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music .  inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us .  it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's .  just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface .  in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations .  donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them .   ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a "" damn you mcbain ! ""  i hear from springfield way ? )  so the movie is cliched .  big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ?  well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre .  donnie brasco fails on both counts .  the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades .  admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm .  depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino's well-earned high style .  the consequences are painful to watch .  its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent .  perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco .  maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks .  if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes .  depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats .  who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ?  but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn't so true after all .

"georges polti once wrote a paper called "" the thirty-six dramatic situations , "" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations .  this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , "" there's nothing new under the sun . ""  the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion .  there's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing .  drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall .  making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather "" through the back door . ""  parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day .  the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block .  even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach .  this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer .  although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive .  on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns .  only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers .  perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la "" dawson's creek . ""  needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be .  there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it .  in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off .

"as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding , especially three times .  but , alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber .  it's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything .  the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful .  this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor .  well , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded .  along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber .  thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience .  the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own .  this is there strictly for the kids .  the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs .  although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone .  the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible .  admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor ) .  the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable .  the basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ?  this just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance .  as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie .  giving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it's best forgotten , and prof . brainard's flying robot weebo .  giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn't for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie .  the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well , but it wasn't and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good .  now , weebo is a totally different story .  it's a robot that prof . brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too .  this is a really original idea , well maybe not , but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie .  yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters .  the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all .  the acting by robin williams ( prof .  brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced .  most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 .  people when stood up at the altar , don't usually give third chances .  or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards , but what can be expected this is a children's movie .  flubber , as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect .  with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great .  it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end , but it does not wash up to the original .  kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they'll probably enjoy the whole movie .  as a movie it's just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that .

" "" an intimate , character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life , "" read the press notes for _reach_the_rock_ .  i'm not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow , completely uninvolving bore i saw--at least , it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film .  alessandro nivola plays robin fleming , a troubled , directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town .  police sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window , then returns , all without quinn ever noticing .  also added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn's dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) .  with a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of '80s youth films and _home_alone_ ) finally approach something close to a point .  turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes's main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired "" live in the present and for the future "" message .  most moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time .  wide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises .  such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors , but it leaves audiences with a booby prize .

"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire .  usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein .  to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat .  but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you .  by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors .  not in these times .  all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade .  without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity .  which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half .  not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower .  with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims .  you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains .  blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual .  the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost .  it's all hokum and nonsense , of course .  but the filmmakers play it straight .  unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings .  you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter .  another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero .  also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs .  he must also be proficient in the martial arts .  why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me .   ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . )  wesley snipes is buff as blade .  he growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey .  blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill .  this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face .  today's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee .  they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes .  they are more farcical than frightful .  this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening .

"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) .  the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) .  his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .  i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! ""  it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie .  and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?  auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen .  kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more "" .  and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character "" . . . grammar  be damned ) .   "" how did you know that ? ""  the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along .   .   .  since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently .  he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .  this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles .  their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends "" .  reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .  although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .  affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch .  the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting .  it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )  james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .  ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him .  which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .  he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .  though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant .  this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner .  included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .  though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience .  the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .  it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau   ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this .  he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart .  problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .  character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .  the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .  but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .  charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .  she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .  gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .  these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .

"the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing .  however , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel .  and , considering the quality of species 2 , it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead .  the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is .  if you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience .  of course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn't be able to get into an "" r "" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies .  there's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring .  this is a grade z exploitation flick that's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment .  somewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as "" erotic . ""  i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism .  sure , there's a lot of sex and nudity , but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions .  anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater .  i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) .  although the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone .  this creature , dubbed "" eve "" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile .  meanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars .  a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them .  ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he's soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session .  his intention is obviously world domination .  standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick's fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) .  but when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there's no damping his ardor .  i'm not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) .  michael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run .  ditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick's father -- "" underused "" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( "" invisible "" would be more like it ) .  george dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general .  meanwhile , justin lazard's performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge's limited abilities look good by comparison .  the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick .  complete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics .  director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness .  do i recommend the movie ?  absolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do .  here's hoping there's no species 3 .

" "" jack frost , "" is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching .  this does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other .  jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn't spend nearly enough time with them .  when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas .  halfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies .  switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack's death .  when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack's spirit .  jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise .   "" frosty the snowman , "" is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn't work at all .  after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , "" jack frost , "" quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play .  since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , "" what happens after you die ? ""  or , "" how does it feel to be a snowman ? ""  but instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie .  the performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this .  michael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ?  i have always liked kelly preston .  she is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997's , "" nothing to lose , "" and , "" addicted to love . ""  joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent .  in one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman .  this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son .  since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue .  some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : "" you da man , "" says charlie .   "" no , i da snowman , "" replies jack .  or how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : "" snowdad is better than no dad . ""  do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ?  the snowman , created by john henson's creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year's unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , "" jack frost , "" but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects .  either way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project .  as a seasonal holiday picture , "" jack frost , "" is pretty much a clunker .  a better christmas film from this year is , "" i'll be home for christmas . ""  better yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , "" it's a wonderful life , "" "" a christmas story , "" or , "" prancer .

"the spy game is up .  you can thank charlie's angels -- the movie -- for that .  when did banality and pandering become okay ?  just steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that's a movie ?  charlie's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i've seen in ages .  charlie's angels is dumb .  just plain dumb .  as we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie .  they all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don't seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion .  and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party .  the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company .  of course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe .  the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels' hair .  the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie's manservant , or , more to the point , the angels' pimp .  the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke's long-lost brother .  charlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight .  nothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels' actions .  it feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one .  diaz is a knucklehead .  barrymore is the "" dangerous one , "" mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role .  liu is just . . .  lucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit .  the list of movies from which charlie's angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing .  the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan's movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv's friends .  it's a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year's favorite , go .  then again , what can you expect from a director known solely as "" mcg . ""  there is no camp value in the film , no interesting main characters , no invigorating action scenes , no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players .  note to hollywood : next time , let's leave the tv shows on the tv .

"based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) .  can you say . . . the  third times not a charm ?  plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week .  critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture .  when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign .  i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes .  when you consider that the other "" part "" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign .  and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this "" big "" summer blockbuster .  it blows .  or as they say in french , "" eet blows "" .  could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ?  maybe .  could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ?  perhaps .  or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ?  naaaaaaah !  a bad movie is a bad movie .  on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in .  branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped .  smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others .  i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie .  then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh  yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked .  little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) .  he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career .  kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 .  they have two kids together , greta simone and owen .  one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has "" kasdan "" written on it .  lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss .  salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english .  she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas .  since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films .  she stands 5'2 "" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother .  one of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) .  another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle .

"when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart , it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest , or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence .  the latter's the case with john mctiernan and "" the thirteenth warrior , "" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring '98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernan's "" the thomas crown affair "" remake , a flick that got good reviews .  you don't have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that "" thirteenth "" won't be so lucky .  reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton , whose "" eaters of the dead "" novel provides "" warrior "" 's source ( and its initial title ) , this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like "" braveheart "" without any of the passion .  but the bloodshed certainly remains : there's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills , though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness .  these circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside .  the good guys are loud , crude , often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot , which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly .  they're also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises .  you'll wince , you'll groan , you'll grouse , "" haven't we seen this guy killed twice before ? ""  banderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok .  he's not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don't exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and "" the thirteenth warrior "" wisely doesn't pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough .  let the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there's still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story .  it isn't the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( "" funny girl "" ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic "" indiana jones and the temple of doom "" -esque chase through the villains' underground lair .  all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between "" die hard "" -helmer mctiernan and "" jurrasic park "" -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments .  heard during "" the thirteenth warrior "" 's final scene : a dog whimpering .  how appropriate .

"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable .  i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics .  we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too .  this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) .  the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno .  so , it does indeed have some plusses . . .  in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff .  and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .  this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? )  far too annoying far too often .  like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character .  at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though .   "" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement .  some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things !  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he'd be . . . well ,  he'd be a good screenwriter .  instead , this project may have sunk his career .  he wrote the ( ha ha ! )  script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed .  the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( "" basic instinct "" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones .  the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer .  after the supposed street-smart young "" lady "" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the "" stardust hotel "" .  nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away .  first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club .  she sells her hot little wares at "" the cheetah "" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience .  hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number . . .  maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the "" stardust hotel "" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) .  crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) .  he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show .  crystal gets nomi onto the "" stardust "" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi "" earns "" the role of crystal's understudy .  the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal .  it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's "" not a whore "" .  that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous .  of course she is !  she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that .  we're supposed to root for her .  no way !  she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax .  she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is .  the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more .  it sure ain't character development !  plummer also appeared in "" speed "" in '94 in a smaller , yet better role .  this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control .  kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in "" blue velvet "" .  that picture was weird , but some critics claim it's one of the best movies of the '80s .  now ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too .  his sleazy character is important to "" showgirls "" , but we don't learn anything about him .  he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie .  is he a villain ?  who cares !  ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit .  everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool .  what few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is .  everyone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge .  it's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) .  if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?  it's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage .  berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body .  after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession .  perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford .  oops , they're bad actors , too .  well , at least , they're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone .  useless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and "" holier than thou "" jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , "" saved by the bell "" , before breaking onto the big screen .

"when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games .  why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ?  the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw .  this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack .  the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the "" outworld "" , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity .  the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined .  here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation .  how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , "" i knew love would keep us together , "" since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh .  there are some seriously stupid things in this movie .  take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the "" inner winds "" , generated by earth's magma flows .  you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast .  how fast ?  as katana says , "" you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . ""  what ?  later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn "" red "" williams , otherwise known as "" saber "" on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu .  how do we know this is where she went ?  there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii .  remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign .  i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are .  there's a lot of major flipping action , too .  the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another .  do they land and immediately get into the fighting ?  does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ?  do they collide in mid-air ?  no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away .  why did they need those metal balls to travel ?  everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b .  i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics .  the movie's thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly .   "" ouch "" was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one .  you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next .  it seems that's all there is in this movie .  maybe it is .  as i had mentioned , the acting is bad .  there's not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny .  after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , "" you look good in mud .  no , really , you do . ""  remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang .  brian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv's the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it's more the script's fault than his own that he doesn't have anything original to say .  the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half .  another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene .  all in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids .  hey , just like the video game !

"at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise .  its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power .  he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents .  given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge .  eleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom .  along the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell .  talon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) .  fortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) .  then , everything ends happily .  unfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds .  what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes .  never once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly .  this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia .  after telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards .  wait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ?  if that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ?  and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ?  these questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film .  another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to "" wait "" , and then he just rides off !  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure .  even some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work .  it just completely fails altogether miserably .  the only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career .  the score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is .  my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) .  ironically , though , before the film's credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow .  to my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million .  critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right .  leonard maltin rightfully called it "" second rate in scripting , and acting "" and at-a-glance film reviews called it "" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore "" .  i totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% !  will be forgotten about .  there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer .  i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing .  in fact , my insults don't even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time .

"200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981 .  monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party .  everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things .  this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes .  as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all .  this disappointed me greatly .  the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion .  lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd .  the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that .  this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that .  janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin .  she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's .  this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent .  there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie .  when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed .  the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party .  at the bar , he runs into two more girls .  the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names .  ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance .  featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad .  christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie .  the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost .  they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night .  this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent .  hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good .  she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress .  another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr .  jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't .  kate hudson is a huge klutz .  she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie .  they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well .  this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance .  mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad .  he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable .  there is not much to say about the performances in the film .  none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not .  the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance .  i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo .  the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes .  martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 .  the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from "" i want candy "" to "" tainted love . ""  the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s .  during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , "" is there a reason to this ?  is there any moral story ?  is there a point ?  are any of the events going on in the film necessary ?  do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? ""  the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over .  the plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible .  maybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better .  the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many .

"it's a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .  the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .  osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .  not that there's anything wrong with scatology .  i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .  it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .  you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .  osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .  the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .  adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing .  osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .  the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .  he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .  frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .  he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .  frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .  it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .  nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth .  like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .  after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .  here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .  basically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre .  and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click .  it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .  the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .  after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , "" funny , he doesn't look fluish . ""  and the jokes don't rise above that level .  the live action scenes are no better .  frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .  he's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .  osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .  the animation is rather two-dimensional and flat .  it lacks scope and depth .  it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .

""  after making "" mission : impossible "" , brian de palma has a lot to live up to .  by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience .  and the possibilities are certainly there , but the result is a great disaster .  starting in a near future , with a prologue copied from "" apollo 13 "" , de palma slowly builds up his "" story "" .  the human race has already set foot on mars .  a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened .  this is basically the whole plot .  so it's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours .  but de palma manages to do that .  it is not a very good achievement .  as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake .  the film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is .  david mamet's dialogue , while trying to seem natural , is distant and simply fake .  de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot .  the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick's "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , "" apollo 13 "" and "" godzilla "" .  to make time pass , the creators have inserted several "" refreshing "" scientific details , that would not convince a half-crazed frog .  it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp-offs from several great science fiction films and stories .  when it finally presents an almost original idea , it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity .  i can't even call this film predictable , since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this .  sometimes it gets so cheesy , that you'll start laughing when you're supposed to cry and cry when you're supposed to laugh .  you'll see enormous sandstorms , hear mysterious sounds and , last but not least , on this "" constantly surprising "" tour you'll see -- an alien .  it's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but "" lost in space "" is actually better .  that's an achievement in itself !  director brian de palma has stroke gold with "" untouchables "" that became an instant american classic .  it is for this film that he will be remembered , while all his other failures will be forgotten .  he'll live to fight another day !  i send the actors my condolences , since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters .  and both the cinematography , production design and art direction are very decent .  it is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10 .  unfortunately their hard work was in vain .  if you have problems with insomnia , i recommend you this film .  if you're not asleep within the first half hour , consult your doctor .

" * * * the following review contains some harsh language . . .  but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ?   * * *  cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b . harmon written and directed by : jeff b . harmon running time : 97 minutes   "" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside . ""  --- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance .  isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) .  when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger .  instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) .  april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up .  mr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality .  in actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) .  when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style .  instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married .   ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? )  april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way .  the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it .  mr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own .  i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs .  either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie .  the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews "" .  if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent .  as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get .  i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes .  it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society .  how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ?  i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me .  again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully .  as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy .  despite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day .  speaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain't ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying .   "" i'm a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith .  it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based .  the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan .  i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired .  one particular musical number , "" lesbian rock "" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan .  the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll .  the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( "" lesbian rock "" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film .  once the "" isle of lesbos reprise "" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all .  why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ?  isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com .  the transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 .  in many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) .  this film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it .  if you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out .  i , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . .  wait . aren't gladiator films considered to be . . .  oh , never mind .

"there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it .  then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes .  writer-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category .  weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters , herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories .  hitmen lee ( james spader ) and his partner dosmo ( danny aiello ) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox ( teri hatcher ) lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked .  an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops , ( jeff daniels ) and wes ( eric stoltz ) .  a murder is not vice territory , flirting with asian prostitues is , but wes would rather play inquisitive detective .  meanwhile , washed-up director , teddy ( paul mazursky ) is about to end his life .  but before he can do that , he must find a good home for his dog .  enter nurse audrey ( marsha mason ) , who takes the dog and teddy for a ride .  stuffy art dealer , allan hopper ( greg cruttwell ) has kidney stones .  while struggling about his fancy house , he switches between moaning in self-pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary's ( glenne headly ) plain appearance .  don't be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on .  you might like that feeling of cluelessness .  herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes .  the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't stunning by any means though .  the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman's real-life heroes in short cuts , even though they are interesting and funny .  funny , that is if you aren't comparing them to the likes of tarantino's pulp chcaracters .  the tie-up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of ( director's name ?  guy who also did last seduction ) red rock west .  two days isn't a bad movie but there isn't much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters .  it'll keep you guessing alright but you won't remember the answers five minutes after the credits .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

"okay , okay .  maybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others .  howewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash .  boy , was i wrong !  in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes .  by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers .  not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense .  of course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest .  in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie .  oh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other .  i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie .  often , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing .  how many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ?  too many .  i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . .  simply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience .  my recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch .  you'll be looking at it for most of the movie .  my .  rent die hard .  read a book .  stare at the sky .  do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid .  the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly .  they probably like wrestling too : - ) .

"the first in a very long list of things wrong with "" i still know what you did last summer "" is the title .  think about it for a second .  if the last movie was called "" i know what you did last summer "" , wouldn't the next movie have to be "" i still know what you did two summers ago "" ?  if anyone working on this movie had an i . q .  greater than five would have thought about it logically and said , "" hey . . .  wait a minute "" .  but alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won't hold them to that .  what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick .  i guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the "" kind of "" ) .  it wasn't great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did .  there are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start .  first of all , i guess , is the setting .  the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting .  exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ?  the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through .  in one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can't get out , no matter how hard she tries .  when julie discovers she's going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue .  now , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin' thing off ?  in another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , "" just don't tell anybody it rained the whole time . ""  oh yeah , i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i'll crack jokes anyway .  after all , it is in the script .  the film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the "" re-animator himself , jeffrey combs .  he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie .  way to go , jeffrey .  i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it's head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson .  with "" scream "" and even it's sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter .  his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think "" i still know "" has really suffered by not having him on board .  the cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one .  even though the movie doesn't have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two "" scream "" s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other .  i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another "" the killer is back ! ""  cliffhanger , he said "" who is this time , the grandma ? ""  all in all , "" i still know "" tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt .  i mean , it's okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . .

"a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product .  eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm .  dan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed "" mission from god "" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago .  as we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother's death in prison years ago .  completely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away .  but elwood isn't completely without family .  it seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on .  despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band .  working as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother's affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet .  following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j .  evan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood .  when bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock .  meanwhile , cab's personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin .  >from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between .  those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story .  only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours .  for those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing .  appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors .  blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie .  many , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don't have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you'll be bored out of your skull .  much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd's self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience .  and seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long .  unfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film .

"in double jeopardy , the stakes are high .  think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker .  the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script .  `alex , i'll take homicide for $400 . . . '  libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life .  one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat .  libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared .  she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening .  nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband .  now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans .  if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further .  but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s . cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters .  during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen .  i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals .  most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production .  one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison .  jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals ) .  judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities .  while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant .  the actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely .  and now , back to the plot .  while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice .  this law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband . . .  who may still be alive .  yes , you heard right .  the movie degenerates into a cross-country chase , where everything you expect to happen . . .  does .  the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road ) .  ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here .  at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars .  unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep .  but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments .  judd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer' .  hmmm . . .  perhaps this would have made a good comedy .  it is disappointing , because there are the makings of a competent action film here .  it's nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver , and will entertain those who aren't turned off by the woeful story-line .   ? tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn't fool most children .

"when i watch a movie like mike nichols' what planet are you from ?  i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me .  it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this . . .  this . . .  thing .  i shift uncomfortably in my seat .  i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted "" funny "" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award .  it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame .  i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols .  do any of these names make you instantly shudder ?  the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here .  granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players .  garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show .  and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty .  so explain this . . .  this . . .  thing .  what planet are you from ?  purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon .  but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment .  garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) .  his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her .  they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes .  imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results !  the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . .  i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones . . .  whoops , too late . )  the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise .  the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of "" comedy . ""  it isn't funny the first time .  it isn't funny the eighth time .  it isn't funny the eighteenth time .  if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious .  garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag .  he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside .  kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks .  wow .  what a magnificent bastard .  nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball .  when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before .  the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics .  shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings .  shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . .  they get married .  yup .  the next day .  cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too !  bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . .  if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species .  she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic .  there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant .  when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings "" high hopes "" ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , "" now you can't leave me . ""  we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of "" guilt , "" but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing .  and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . .  for real , i suppose , though i'm not sure exactly what prompted it .  what's the message i derive from all this ?  men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . .  well , maybe something will click .  ha ha . . .  ha ?  i'm thankful such broad cynicism isn't frequently allowed to run so rampant .  let's all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one .  there's also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity .  goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis .  it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition .  instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away .  further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies .  but let's not dwell on this any longer , i've already wasted plenty of your time and my own .  let's move on , forget about what we've seen here , and get on with our lives .  and to help us out , let's end things on a happy note . . .  congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week's "" title ! ""  award , for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie's name .  ",0
"back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films .  he couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados .  that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products .  the hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them .  chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) .  surviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent .  he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians .  since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action .  well , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting .  it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films .  we know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension .  in the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade .  during the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris .  that caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation .  the photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it .

"i am a steven seagal fan .  i only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things .  any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on .  seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine .  not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull .  in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest .  he's also put on quite a lot of weight .  small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ?   ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) .  as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past .  while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole .  it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing .  an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons .  the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) .  it's the other changes that disappoint .  for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's "" in living colour . ""  wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest .  as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching .  a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble .  he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies .  again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual .  heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film .  is that a lot to ask of the seague ?  too much .  seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone .  not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think .  no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows .  that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else .  we trusted him .  we got to know him .  now , betrayal .  i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again .  i'll try , but it won't be easy .  if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out .  it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences .  after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan .  everybody makes mistakes once in awhile .

"an 18-foot-high , 43-foot-long dragon is the computer-generated co- star of this strictly-by-the-numbers sword 'n' sorcery flick .  as voiced by sean connery , "" draco "" is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well-deserving of his 23 minutes of screen time .  he walks , talks , flies , fries , and even fakes his own death , all with the help of 96 computer-aided animators .  too bad that ilm ( industrial light and magic ) couldn't spare some special effects for dragonheart's * human * co-stars .  a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be .  he's a near-total loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight .  david thewlis' evil king has a high hiss factor ( hf ) , though he's more of a mumbling oddity than anything else .  oh , and there's some redhead in a '90's wig , who runs around either screaming or scowling , depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant .  the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions , julie christie ( ! ) as the good queen mother , a band of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavy-metal concert , and , believe or it not , the speaking spirit of king arthur .  bring out your dead !  unfortunately , when we add it all together ( draco + fringe bits - quaid - thewlis ) , the sum total amounts to zero .  dragonheart is , well , too much of too little .  director rob cohen ( dragon : the bruce lee story ) has made a big , expensive movie that , while ambitiously plotted , is both murky and predictable .  and overscored .  and self-important .  and the list goes on .

"after enduring mariah carey's film debut , glitter , i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker .  in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , "" you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done . ""  to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done .  sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter .  everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous .  start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie .  the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers .  worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 .  meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother .  influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . "" lucky 7 "" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star .  in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on "" the roller coaster of superstardom . ""  in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom .  i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . .  you'll figure it out .  the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun .  but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better .  what a mistake .  the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons .  instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes .  which brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said .  mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .  she actually looks scared during her one love scene .  but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse .  so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .  even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly .  they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , "" billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , "" and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , "" oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . ""  everyone in the film is a device , and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear .  to say more would be a waste .  there's so much wrong with this film .  and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get .  but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie .

"ever feel you're spending your whole life on the net ( ouch ! ) , eating , breathing and excreting web sites ?  that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net ?  that you get your best sex on the net ?  if first-time director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers , he would .  as it is , he settles for characters talking on the phone .  denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation , where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone .  it's a satire - and a sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones , call-waiting and answering machines run our lives .  the problem : denise calls up is a movie about an idea .  a darn good one , but still an 80 minute-long idea .  and despite salwen's attempt at plots and sub-plots , despite some genuinely funny moments , you can predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes .  you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film , they would rather be talking on the phone .  here's salwen's plot : while all the characters are in a dysfunctional , telefixated limbo , loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child , courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank .  as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name , his friends - and his friends' friends - get involved , courtesy of call-waiting and double-lines .  in the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for .  both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone .  with repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ?  denise calls up scores with some inspired moments .  mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine .   ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . )  but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie .  the pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters .  and the ending is literally a non-event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they will .  we get the point .  the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears .  pun intended .  there's even a on the movie's web site where you can win cellular phones ( as if we haven't had enough of these things already ) .  watch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

"maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there's a world of difference between artists and technicians .  the artist has a vision to create something new .  he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before .  a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox .  obviously successful films need both skills .  brian de palma is a masterful technician .  he's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock .  he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote .  aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead .  in de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick .  to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 "" .  i enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters "" .  nasa has set its sights for mars .  when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet .  they don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe .  and it's all so boring .  there are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin .  when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching .  error .  the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off .  error .  the alien is laughable .  error .  the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable .  error .  there's some nice eyecandy .  the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool .  a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world .  maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic .  but there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before .  from "" 2001 "" , there's the rotating space station , the blinding white room .  >from "" close encounters "" , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens .  the list goes on .  the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues .  even gary sinise and tim robbins can't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing .  no one seems to care about anything that happens .  you won't either .  the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day .  they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .

"i'll be the first to admit it .  when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch .  yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine .  certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i'll  gonna tell it the way i remember it . ""  anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations .  instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) .  finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) .  the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s .  finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) .  during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) .  borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor .  ok . . . maybe  that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film .  and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress .  anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy .  and then the plot moves on .  enter miss havisham . . . or  ms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) .  abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid .  with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role .  although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film .  joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) .  for no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella .  perhaps it's her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before .  in any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her .  even when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there's nothing .  in fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear's gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets .  at this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella's character , and couldn't care less about the two characters .  the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow .  she fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity .  there's obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you're more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character .  without a strong estella , finn's obsession seems baseless .  you wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life .  in fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot .  finn's relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical .  what's more fascinating are his interactions with deniro .  although it's only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create .  it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film .  some of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact .  finn's art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect .  we never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful .  as a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film .  modernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare's romeo+juliet ) .  simply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock .  but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations .  as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you'd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film .

"the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing .  jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican .  his and his men's mission is to clean the earth from vampires .  they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them .  valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself .  for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross .  with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight .  after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . .  i have never liked john carpenter and his style .  after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed .  john carpenter remains john carpenter .  however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time .  neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original .  but there are some things that are interesting .  the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance .  at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life .  otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy .  carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere .  set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness .  more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil .  the cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement .  music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice .  when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing .  he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the "" breed of evil "" .  woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance .  daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner .  the other cast members are struggling .  because the film doesn't take itself too seriously , it stays afloat .  still it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience .

"hey , i've got a great idea for a movie !  ok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so !  what's that ?  sounds too boring ?  ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are "" i'm in pain ! ""  looks !  what's that ?  that still doesn't sound funny to you ?  how about if we through in some "" ewwwww ! ""  looks ?  still not funny ?  if you answered "" no , that doesn't sound funny "" , then ( ding ding ding ! )  you're absolutely correct !  for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's "" seinfeld "" ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion .  what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell .  what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs .   .   .  namely , talent !  backing up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce .  just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it's final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton's names .  the irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton's and not lachman , there is nothing much to do .   .   .  except run away and join an amish community .  first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn .  alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) .  allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple !  this entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning !  the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing .  it's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get !  bryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either .  in fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first "" power rangers "" movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? !  now that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it .  it bumped seven films up a notch on my "" worst of "" 1997 movie list .  that's right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year's worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn't have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list .  if you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all !

"when considering david fincher's latest film , "" the game "" , four words come to mind .   "" don't believe the hype . ""  this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of "" seven "" , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe .  the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy .  this isn't simply virtual reality .  this is real life with a deadly twist .  on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn ) .  conrad has a special birthday present for his brother .  he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services .   "" they make your life fun , "" conrad tells him .  nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , "" fantasy role-playing , "" as he calls it .  then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about .  he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have .  nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening .  of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect .  douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands .  one of those films , "" basic instinct "" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven .  the premise of "" the game , "" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , "" total recall . ""  in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation .  yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience .  we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn .  in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't .  all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed .  now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again .   "" don't believe the hype . ""   "" the game "" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride .  as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles .  by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot .  is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ?  no ? well , how about sharon stone ?  thought so ) .  if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films .  there is no suspense here .  trust me , i looked hard to find some .  i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations .  fincher aim's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas .  there are those that might say "" the game "" is not intended to be viewed literally .  i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film .  the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues .  there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who's in on the whole thing .  he is charged by his paranoia .  he is looking at the world through new eyes .  it is the last thought-provoking moment in the film .  from there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us .  any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device .  at the outset , we're told each "" game "" is tailored to the individual .  ultimately , this "" game "" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul .  yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is .  i wanted to like this film more than i did .  i look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized .  i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn't mean we were seeing what was really happening .  bryan singer's "" the usual suspects "" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas .  also , there is the underrated "" jacob's ladder , "" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism .  here are two examples of films that don't simply manipulate for manipulations' sake .  there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place .  one major issue that comes up in "" the game "" is whether or not the whole "" illusion "" is just a highly sophisticated con game .  well , i can tell you right now , after you've spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing .

"godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie .  a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind .  the script isn't just "" dumbed down , "" it's lobotomized .  godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone .  presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage .  that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible .  this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors .  stargate was a financial success .  independence day was a runaway hit .  and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million .  nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid .  godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close .  there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly .  frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning .  there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure .  maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level .  godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone .  the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity .   ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? )  worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting .  with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse .  even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking .  independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action .  in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking .  actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him .  the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply .  after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple .  he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway .  in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams .  on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla .  in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific .  in nick's words , godzilla is "" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . ""  as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station .  along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla .  then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment .  instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city .  unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring .  the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall .  he could climb the empire state building .  at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over .  godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor .  there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel .  both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : "" ebert , "" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and "" gene "" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager .  ebert's re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , "" thumbs up for new york . ""  the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it's used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome .  and , although the "" characters "" don't serve any real purpose , they keep popping up .  godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast .  this is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard .  that's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren't a-list names .  then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine .  maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief .  ultimately , it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie .  tristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof .  it may also be word-of-mouth-proof .  those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say .  so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it's like spitting into the wind .  emmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors .  it's probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had .

"this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie .  i * did * go into this one with high expectations .  i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks .  i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining .  i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film .  boy , was i wrong !  another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story !  the story , you ask ?  well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk .  he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic .  lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks .  when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling .  they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard .  the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in .  they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house .  turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage .  she starts having some wild hallucinations .  later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) .  said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ .  the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing .  it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again .  so , she helps him kill three businessmen .  scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back .  problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin .  he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother .  guess they couldn't get the original actor back .  who knows .  scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy .  he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . ""  somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun .  this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ?

"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors .  when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture .  you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries .  i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories .  i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey .  the badness of patch adams is stupefying .  it's confounding .  i can't believe a film can be this bad .  and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make .  in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human .  in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself .  while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings .  so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients .  he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people .  he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor .  naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams .  so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have .  and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 .  on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) .  but the film fails fundamentally in execution .  every scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard .  take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus .  we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad .  later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively .  and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad .  but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions .  real drama is character-based .  you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it .  we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness .  real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry .  that's why patch adams is not real drama .  it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene .  even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score .  sentimentality like this is indeed bad .  but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes .  you see , patch is a really great student .  he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating .  but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor .   "" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds .  well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients .  not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort .  most of us have to study .  and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death .  oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to "" prevent death , "" but to "" improve the quality of life ! ""  yes !  that is true !  and you can not do that without studying .  you can not do that without going to medical school .  what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later .  follow the rules ?  bah !  who needs the rules !  only uptight doctors follow the rules .  the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants .  and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic .  a free clinic .  in the middle of the forest .  where patients can be taken to be helped .  for free .  how will patients be transported to the free clinic ?  will it have an emergency room ?  or is it just for mental patients ?  and who , may i ask , will pay for it ?  the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent .  reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams .  i know nothing about him .  if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them .  but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony .  and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting .  actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting .  he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words .  i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words .  i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be .  patch adams is the cheapest of them all .

"a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african-american .  an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession .  it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get .  i learned that the word "" bitch "" is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used .  it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing .  they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money .  it's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place .  this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears .  these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face .  the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite .  also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life .  we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd .  they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money .  these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves .   "" priests need nuns , '' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp .   "" doctors need nurses .  so ho's need pimps . ''  as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors .  the race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human .  while , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community .  we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations .  the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work .  there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being "" macks "" and "" players "" or "" real pimps "" and "" perpetrator pimps , "" but no further clarity is attempted .  it is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word .  the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame .  the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to .  danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe .  while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer .

"after the huge success of "" the exorcist "" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely .  needless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with .  to start the "" story "" it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) .  now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan's body , before it is too late .  some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn't go anywhere .  louise fletcher is alright for what it's worth , but she could have done a lot better than this .  the direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn't figure out .  in fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad .  for those exorcist fans who haven't seen this one , i recommend renting it .  i actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else !  im not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere .  bad , bad , bad movie .

"everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . '  in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience .  the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches .  dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches .  the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone .  'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill .  the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's  humans .  that should teach us for squishing all those bugs .  what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace .  perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become .  if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest .  the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie .  there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking .  if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense .  in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them .  there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch .  the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them .  the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average .  sorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really .  the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever .  their reasonable good fun , however .  mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good .  like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content .  it may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well .  but looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong .  a good opportunity , then , wasted .  a shame .  overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998  ",0
"the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes .   "" it wasn't me ! "" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others .  well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either .  fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth .  as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa .  when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void .   .   .  fred .  yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known .  for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play .  his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records .  overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist .  from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence .  you know , standard kid movie material .  almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role .  we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it .  while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable .  to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny .  why ?  because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring .  classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy .  stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him .  peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it's best .  williams , on the other hand , can't garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory .  as for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever .  this is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach .  giving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times .  the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children !  i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn't crack up over every little thing .  then again , maybe they were asleep .  some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren't the targeted audience and therefore aren't meant to , and won't , enjoy them .  sadly , it's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it's presented right .  a two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ?  and saying that a parent's perspective isn't important is quite a poor theory to have when they're the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place .

"i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws .  but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american .  or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence .  this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role .  if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work .  although geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself .  this is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) .  in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind .  it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail .  it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful .  yet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch .  he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison .  his cell , food and rights  all terrible .  now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder .  jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family .   as the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered .  red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes .  what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act .  this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption .  but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch .  if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible .  it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before .  if that wasnt bad enough , red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions .  shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself .  taking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be .  although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the films main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway .  whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again .  martin vailwhere are you ?

"studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film .  are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ?   "" 54 "" belongs in the elite group of films known as "" the big disappointments "" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished .  i was heavily awaiting "" 54 , "" not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this "" edgy "" film .  perhaps more importantly , "" 54 "" is part of the blossoming subgenre , "" the 70s nostalgia film , "" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with "" boogie nights "" and "" the last days of disco "" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from "" boogie nights , "" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from "" the last days of disco , "" not to mention several others .   "" 54 "" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it .  this is a definite plus .  here's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening .  the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people .  but this film doesn't let that happen .  it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) .  he's dim-witted , into being part of "" the scene , "" and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a  bit like "" saturday night fever , "" 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him .  poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been .  shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from "" clueless "" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame .  although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film .  the film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) .  rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that .  notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails .  first time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much .  his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject .  it's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route .  the studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough .  some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini's "" la dolce vita "" ) , and when i watched "" 54 , "" i didn't particularly want to stay .

"starship troopers is a bad movie .  i mean , a really , really , bad movie .  not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .  looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .  that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .  the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .  as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand .  eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .  as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .

" "" we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . ""  starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung  taiwan , 24/12/99 .  the millenium approaches .  an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city .  sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus .  the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners .  the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time .  residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap .  this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas .  the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that .  the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background .  instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities .  the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible .  it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background .  the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's .  one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room .  this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways .  example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole .  the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up .  this is what passes for meaningful communication .  and they say romance is dead .  much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are .  there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people .  they are ciphers .  instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles .   ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . )  offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china ) .  she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights .  sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man .  these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail .  when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless .  astaire and rogers this is not .  even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring .  the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium .  others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life .  the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry .  witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty .  american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions .  foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art .  the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation .  if so , he succeeds .  perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't .  if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it .

"the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars .  producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze .  gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry .  cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed .  seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos .  fifty cars , to be exact .  poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly .  if the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip .  literally .  if only someone could save him .  hmmmm . . wonder  what memphis is doing ?  in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of . . . yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension .  shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away .  will he catch him ?  there's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago .  will they get back together ?  shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family .  will they reconnect ?  raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime .  will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ?  can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ?  i'll bet you can .  following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis .  he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts .  in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions .  just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it .  looks like everything might turn out alright after all .  you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins .  that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame .  bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand .  monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis .  or maybe it's just the cars .  duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit .  i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one .  lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material .  the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis .  without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie .  like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal .  too bad his minutes onscreen are so few .  somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes .  every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie .  there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot .  it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test .  imagine the yuks .  there's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick .  it's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk .  the ramifications are never explored .  then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars .  not only is it stupid , but it's against the law .  this is a movie made of pretty , but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along .  gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining , but empty film to leave your memory .

"dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor ( 1996 ) , murphy returns in this abysmal comedy .  he plays doctor john dolittle , who as a child had the ability to understand animals .  however , after being 'exorcised' he loses this ability , and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr mark weller , played by oliver platt . )  however , with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns , and 'comedy' is ready and waiting to happen .  except comedy never does happen .  doctor dolittle , even with the excellent premise , rarely manages to raise a laugh .  poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie , and his performance suffers .  the manic murphy we saw in the 80's is gone , his more mature ( and more boring ) twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90's .  the voices of the animals , which include albert brooks , chris rock ( the 'new' eddie murphy ) and norm mcdonald as 'lucky' the dog are marginally better , and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie .  sadly , most of their lines are pretty dumb .  and they're not 'funny' dumb , like dumb & dumber ( 1994 ) , but just boring dumb .  the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through , in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs .  there are a few good jokes in the script , but they are few and far between .  if i had to choose a favourite performance , it would probably be albert brooks tiger , who has a certain charm about him .  sadly , he's barely in the movie , and rock's really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time .  joke wise , we are thankfully , spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor .  the director , betty thomas , has , well , done better films .  she bought us private parts ( 1997 ) and the brady bunch movie ( 1995 ) which were , sadly , much better than this .  the scenes lack any charm , she just gets the job done .  the animals themselves , are reasonable realistic , although most of them are obviously puppets .  there's an impressive looking tiger , however , and the lip sync is pretty good .  you'd have no problem guessing that most of the close up's are puppets , however , with their jilted movement .  i was hoping jim hensons workshop , who created the furry friends , would have done a better job .  doctor dolittle , in the end , is a disappointment for everyone involved .  murphy has done much better movies ( i . e  trading places ) the director has seen better days , and even the creatures aren't that good .  the target audience , aged between 7-13 , who are undemanding , will probably like it however , thanks to it's dumbed down humour .  everyone else , however , should give doctor dolittle a miss .

"some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr .  magoo being a prime example .  the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images .  if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection .  for a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan .  the story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject .  mr . magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it .  mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased .  like home alone 3 but without any class , mr .  magoo can only be described as painfully bad .  fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity .  the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off .  when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace .  mr .  magoo provides only three such moments .  the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm .  the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog .  angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture .  finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked .  rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon .  he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny .  my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky .  hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not .  mr . magoo runs 1 : 37 .  it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages .  my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie .  he said he liked home alone 3 much more .  his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense .  his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly .

"this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james .  dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom "" doc "" scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : "" stand and deliver ! ""  owing to the increased occurrence of turpin's robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin's area of influence to bring him to justice .  they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) .  their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies .  however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin .  then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner !  there is no doubt that this is a 'sid james' carry on movie .  he excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- don't lose your head' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious .  barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques' small but effective role as the rector's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection .  jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part .  peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw's character appears only briefly in the film .  the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the 'birds of paradise' and sporting a fake french accent .  when her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit !  a carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie .  the jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement .  although nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions .  none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here .  just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres .

"there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director .  of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , "" halloween , "" but he also made 1980's "" the fog , "" and 1987's underrated , "" prince of darkness . ""  heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with "" in the mouth of madness . ""  but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , "" memoirs of an invisible man .

"" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , "" john carpenter's vampires . ""  if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title .  it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , "" vampires . ""  the story is simple .  jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .  since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her .  it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him .  my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ?  well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made .   "" john carpenter's vampires , "" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen .  in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time .  the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .  and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent .  there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .  james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue .  daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .  and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore .  there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , "" john carpenter's vamires , "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's .  he has said that he turned down directing , "" halloween : h20 , "" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it .  and yet , when asked about a "" vampires "" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it .  i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points .

"plot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music .  one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) .  once married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce .  at that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star .  that boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it isn't long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants .  this is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers .  critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , doesn't really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through .  in fact , this isn't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet .  i guess that i was expecting the former going in .  the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant .  but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience .  chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen ) .  well , i personally don't care for those films , and didn't really get into the whole "" show "" atmosphere of this movie either .  i guess i might've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just didn't care enough about the characters to delve into the "" so the butterfly represents his freedom ? ""  side of things .  all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn't make me feel any more fulfilled .  what was hedwig's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ?  what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ?   ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? )  what ever happened to the lawsuit ?  and more . . .  all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat .  if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well .  i didn't get it .  the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either .  then again , i've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen .  some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added "" atmosphere "" of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience .  but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn't leave the theater very satisfied .  i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers .  i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene .  note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single "" mainstream "" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself .  but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the "" official "" critics , while i , a regular "" joblo "" in the audience , just wouldn't get what all the fuss was about .  this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews .  where's joblo coming from ?  moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love's labour's lost ( 8/10 )  ",0
"the happy bastard's quick movie review  wild wild west  a better name for this movie might've been "" wild wild waste "" .  warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad .  but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way .  they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer .  wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon .  if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is .  heck , ten times .  as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well .  here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair .  they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path .  as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess .  but the acting doesn't help either .  kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado .  smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib .  branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard .  and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention .  her acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass "" .  director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either .  even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost .  it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit .  last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable .  at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train .  he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion !  also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks .  last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? !  the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects .  the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show .  there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity .  i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible .  if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will .  if the performances don't bother you , the story will .  if the story doesn't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will .  there's no end to the vicious circle .  go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats .  you'll have a better time .  if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant .  i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .

"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction .  the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel .  so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel .  congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better .  it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good .  the film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting .  several years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered .  the plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien .  now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s .  suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft .  included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) .  together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets .  one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship .  what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances .  director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects .  the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film .  it has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen .  the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting .  that could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film .  but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster .  it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't .  hoffman's acting seems muted .  jackson seems to laid back .  we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads .  levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance .  and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a  cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price .  look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors .  most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects .  levinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer .  perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium .  the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie's poster : "" no sequel . ""  scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don't try .  what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof .  the first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular .  in scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series .  scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn .  of course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive .  but this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project .  some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque .  scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo's mission : impossible 2 and charlie's angels .  it is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they'd coalesce .  they don't .  while the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road .  you can almost hear the reels panting .  scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short .  it's a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie .  the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is .

"the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year's finest films .  so , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled .  it is a rare thing for a children's movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn't you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly "" magical "" piece of work ?  a tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film .  looking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater .  believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city .  the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon .  but after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially .  the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) .  problem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded "" city "" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion .  setting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels .  it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright .  here is where the film took a wrong turn .  up until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience .  the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs .  unfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe .  the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is .  at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown .  at other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget's full cavity search at the airport .  in fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing .  however , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway .  the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child .  another problem i found with the film was it's sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story .  if you're going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine .  it may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition .  but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ?  it just didn't feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie .

"in "" gia "" , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel .  and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) .  i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film .  despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie .  sadly , though , my fears were realized .  it's just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes .  the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn't particularly enjoy the world of fashion .  she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have .  the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab .  this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it .  in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use .  no because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me .  quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed .  the first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging .  we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend .  these early scenes were interesting .  we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before .  the movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model .  >from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end .  it all seemed so excessive .  fine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ?  couldn't the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ?  or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world .  quite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me .  as i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture .  what do they do that warrants a movie ?  strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ?  i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life .  gia did not .  and by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs .  not exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i'm concerned .

"a big , busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch , the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to "" invent "" a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight "" champ "" ( damon wayans ) .   ( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . )  he may be right , in an absurdly accurate way , but the film doesn't give us a reason to care .  as a scathing sports spoof , hype is just that : unfunny , unfocused , and , at times , just plain pointless .  as a commentary on race relations , it's even * less * effective .  the dialogue is the best of this mess , lines like jon lovitz exclaiming "" i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs !

"michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky , goofy best friend to jeff daniels' lawyer character in this ill-fated , and unfunny , "" comedy "" .  plot : richard the actor ( richards ) has to take the place of charles the lawyer ( daniels ) in a real court case , after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party .  the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery .  critique : this movie did not make me laugh once .  perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it .  perhaps .  perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld .  perhaps .  perhaps it was because the movie just wasn't funny .  absolutely .  the lack of humour wasn't the only issue that i had with this film either .  the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision , but unfortunately , they are also lacking in conviction , believability and credibility .  they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake .  the actors were all adequate enough in their roles , but the problem didn't lie in the acting .  i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time , but i can't .  unless of course , you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house .  overall , this movie stinks .  on the good side , charlize theron is darn cute , and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes .  on the bad side , this movie is not funny , interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible .  a person wouldn't even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness .  please skip it .  little known facts : jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becoming an actor/director .  charlize theron grew up on a farm outside benoni , south africa , as the only child .  at the age of 18 her mother made her go to los angeles to try a career in the movie industry .  she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card .  after eight months in la she got her first part .  since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed , specifically in devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) .  charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the "" movie "" , showgirls .  she was quoted as saying "" it was like i had some guardian angel .

"in 1990 , the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg .  eight years later , moore and goldberg's careers aren't exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can't be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog .  forget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games .  good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey .  along the way , jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station , evil truckers , and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists .  every so often , like at the end of a video game "" level "" or "" stage , "" the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf , fresh from the triumph of spice world ) , who wants to steal the cache of guns .  just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who's driving what , all of red's vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red .  i could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack's dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance .  all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting .  once you've seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you've seen it every time .  as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it's that swayze has to reduce himself to such work .  while far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence .  i don't know if it's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog .  regardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ?

"writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard .  harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun .  harder than building a bridge over troubled waters .  and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review .  thrillers are all variations on a theme .  you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet .  you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process .  the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner .  this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . .  is anyone else getting depressed here ?  point is , it's not enough to follow the formula .  you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version .  something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals .  this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way .  without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails .  that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f .  bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire .  richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal .  the jackal is trying to kill someone .  gere is trying to stop him .  will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ?   ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count . )  there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , "" i wonder what happens next ? ""  the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines .  it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium .  throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them .  no surprise .  the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy .  instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script ) .  and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight .  it's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it .  and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not .  what's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids .  as for the performances . . .  bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie .  his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint .  richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance .  sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it's not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) .  writing a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done .  it wasn't done here .  it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones .  do not go see this movie .  you'll only encourage the producers to make more just like it .  instead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud .  anything other than the jackal , which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other , better movies .

"absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff .  it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper .  one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood .  not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence .  continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need .  details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) .  oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities .  a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g .  marshall ) .  while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault .  there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay .  their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman .  in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow .  she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men .  the man ?  he is the president of the united states of america .  where does the film go wrong ?  it cannot be the acting .  clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances .  the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue .  even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre .  the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone .  while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it .  not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax .  rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness .  an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant .  police officers are everywhere , incognito of course .  at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives .  all three parties are unaware of each others presence .  this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position .  he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations .  however , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away .  the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes .  ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap .  the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . .  parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter .  the daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere .  of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family .  again , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot .  however , trying is simply not enough !  the second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . .  everything this film is not .  how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ?  how could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ?  i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film .  director quentin tarantino once said : "" i can make a good movie out of any bad script .

"working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith .  despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) .  the problem is , of course , that there aren't many good roles available for black women .  take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve's bayou , and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim .  as a result , for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo .  actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s .  mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is .  the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags .  unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q .  the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of "" free lobotomy "" lab experiment .  woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places .  her latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper .  now , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr . right , and that he'll be a virgo .  later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo .  it's not love at first sight , however .  things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a "" quiet "" dinner .  in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad "" white "" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it's only fair that we get a "" black "" effort of the same low caliber .  as in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together .  the question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ?  in a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is .  in woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project .  for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) .  sadly , that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional .  despite exuding charm from every pore , there's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson's script .  since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops .

""  in this movie , no one is given anything to do .  sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like . . .  um . . .  a man who doesn't remember anything .  the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel .  sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens .  to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting .  william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city .  jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit .  but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is .  the problem with dark city is this : it's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir .  the essence of film noir isn't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner .  dark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics .  dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic .  it's an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere .

"adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer .  unfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge .  he's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one .  he's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot .  the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia .  adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits .  robbie's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar .  however , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall .  she's the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) .  so , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding .  as far as plots go , it's a pretty thin and tired one .  to fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia .  from boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik's cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae .  and then there's the music . . .  learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele's high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow .  as a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes : the wedding singer vols .  2 , 3 , and 4 !  while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot .  at least last year's my best friend's wedding stirred up the standard "" keep your true love from marrying someone else "" plot by making the rival a nice person .  here , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him .  barrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia .  which leaves us with adam sandler .  he's at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) .  when he's in full nice-guy mode , he's more pathetic than endearing .  the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) .  but none of them work well at all .  buscemi's role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous .  lovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny .  the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film's finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . )  adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man .  while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain .

"i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone .  sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out .  the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff .  hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in .  clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time .  and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it .  one girl said if i'd seen the movie with "" an open mind , "" i would have enjoyed it .  nothing could be further from the truth .  i went into the theater expecting to love the movie .  the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters .  almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way .  when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , "" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen "" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement .  so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter .  i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway .  what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever .  and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like .  where to begin in criticizing this movie ?  the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever .  there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence .  zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero .  so why does this movie get one star out of me ?  well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub .  and if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get .  alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party .  and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) .  as the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) .  the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath .  they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party .  not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy .  at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated .  in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it .  so you can't call it a sex flick .  i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ?  bad .

"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities .  the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge .  such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c . clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k . dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth .  hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings .  most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved .  it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own .  from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre .  with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe .  the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission .  woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son .  entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) .  luc consoles jim with woody's assistance .  the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them .  but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet .  the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars .  they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface .  going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars' .  a strange noise emanates from the rock .  as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc .  back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing .  luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team .  the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger .  meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface .  the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars .  and if so , what is its relationship with us ?  now for the bad news .  the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe .  the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed .  borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava's "" planet of the vampires "" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole .  while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving .  so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use .  the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry .  gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation .  and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse .  and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better .  he's just having too much fun here to give a damn .  the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage .  this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship .  also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation .  but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone .  subtlety is non-existent here .  in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out .  the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower .  the pacing of the film is very leisurely .  after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface .  then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity .  the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum .  there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop .  the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at .  the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring .  the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn't been seen since "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" .  the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth .  the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world .  director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film .  the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage' to hitchcock's "" rope "" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters .  scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution .  but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang .  sadly it is not .  director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production .  the set design and visual effects are all arresting .  but it's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction .  a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals .

" "" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing .  it's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare .  and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents .  it's worse than that .  it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness .  or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness .  in certain circles , "" snake eyes "" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic "" rashomon , "" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb .  in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens .  there's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out .  this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction .  what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and  discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy .  as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened .  this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . then  it takes one wrong step .  we follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out .  but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it .  it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting .  it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible .  events become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina .  that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay .  this time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena .  what went wrong ?  depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this .  depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , "" blow out , "" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece .  but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries .  at least his direction makes up partly for it .  then there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier "" carlito's way , "" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well .  he can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort .  he's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic .  a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup .  he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like .  this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way .  as i was watching the first half hour , i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he'd be given , and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe .  now there's a film .  unfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma .

"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line .  it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin .  the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol .  the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas .  but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message .  its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia .  the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply .  billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country .  everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war .  the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never .  there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether .  the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide .  the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined .  he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage .  the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless .  she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) .  what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her .  even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures .  her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing .  since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use .  the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff .  for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) .  the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation .  the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail .  it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail .  the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity .  the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity .  things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood .  there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded .  this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute .  ummm !

" "" showgirls "" is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating .  and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence .  but if "" showgirls "" is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking .   "" showgirls "" is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter .  director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's "" basic instinct , "" follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer .  it's a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out .  there's the demanding producer .  the loyal friend .  the bitchy competitor .  lest i forget the scummy club owner .  of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity .  unfortunately , "" showgirls "" doesn't satisfy in this department .  verhoeven's slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic .  to make matters worse , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history .  verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel .  you'll be the wiser for it .

"disconnect the phone line .  don't accept the charges .  do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' .  i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so .  the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' .  meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease .  while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery .  `hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests .  for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development .  this is an annoying and ineffective device .  cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems .  if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story .  granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film .  but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck .  the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale .  we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career .  georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . .  `georgia' .  maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog .  ryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' .  kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted .  ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle .  her frenzy is apparent .  for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles .  the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing .  even so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill .  that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film .  my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour .  but really , it's no mystery .  the predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses .  pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations .  it's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable .  uh-uh .  it's a wrong number from the beginning .

"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller .  tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances .  writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little .  van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans .  it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . .   . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ .  while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) .  a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! ""  and "" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! ""  standing out among my favorites .  but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs .  van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual .  early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way .  even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug .  paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode .  in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage .  tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work .  here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise .  for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous .  this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context .  for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box .  as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen .  it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something .  the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired .  tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza .  there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) .  if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . .  before it's too late .  if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . .  that is , if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco .

"the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks .  tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive .  this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail .  what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane .  when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior .  but even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie .  while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time .  while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately .  to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not .  snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later .  tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge .  the sense of deja vu was overwhelming .  i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film .  there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing .  nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie .  downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife .  nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot .  the supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face .  it doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either .  the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory .  as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional .  if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average .  and because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie .  stuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out .  it's director is the usual action movie style .  even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension .  the special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith .  but in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement .  sure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun .  bored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities  ",0
"when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the "" inspector gadget "" tv show with my older brother .  truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis .  i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that .  sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid .  at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me .  despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up .  so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) .  i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well .  rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness .  as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen .  can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ?  right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble .  in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones .  when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( "" oh , hi penny !  is brain with you ? "" ) .  creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another .  the "" plot "" , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series .  matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) ,  a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events .  brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . .  inspector gadget !  >from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) .  there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself .  to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these "" treats "" .  i was just glad that it was over .

"vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family .  as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors .  this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles .  also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes .  in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows .  it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue .  apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn't bother to write any jokes into the script .  at least that's the way it looks when watching this turkey .  about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point .  by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags .  i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in .  they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film .  the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures .  rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film's best moments .  every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film .  which brings me to the best moment of the film .  the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play .  christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by .  it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen .  too bad .

" "" idle hands "" is distasteful , crass and derivative .  if an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness .  plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo .  the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers .  the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed .  along the way the hand kills anton's parents and his two best friends .  the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them .  that is the level of this's atrocity's humor .  the movie treats death as a joke .

"if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then "" bully "" 's for you .  based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , "" bully "" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood .  the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers .  in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( "" kids "" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities .  in terms of the incident and what provoked it , "" bully "" stirs up nothing new .  the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane .  the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department .  he hounds and harries and humiliates his "" best friend "" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby .  simply remove him from the equation .  marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off .  there's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment .  they did it because they wanted to , and because they could .  what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material .  not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in "" bully "" but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it .  gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in "" there's something about mary "" look like the height of subtlety ! ) .  clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about .  the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera .  the conclusion of "" bully "" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime .  it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it .   "" bully "" aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death .  ",0

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent .  it would be derisive .  it would be glib .  it would be dismissive .  it would be entirely accurate .  rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging .  the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous .  the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables .  despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities .  consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent .  louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene .   ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . )  meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice .  serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky .  it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest .  it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past .  none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes .  director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one .  while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization .  to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies .  i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened .  to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question .  the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing .  the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching .

"my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) .  i didn't see the first film until much later .  so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it .  watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever .  you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before .  this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story .  plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless .  and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ?  don't get me wrong though . . .  it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics .  most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is .  horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn't cut it .  a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video .  it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set .  the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) .  the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix .  also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film's director of photography .  other extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film's original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film's original theatrical trailer .  some dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don't have dvd-rom capabilities i can't really get into that .  the commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular .  the first thing of note is that it's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago .  i'm not saying that's a negative thing , just pointing it out .  everyone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn't say much at all .  most of the time you'll forget he's even there .  everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they're commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible .  the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series .  also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . .  however you can only access one easily .  the other is hidden in what's called "" the labyrinth "" , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created .  basically , it's an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film .  finding it though is both a chore and a bore .

"arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year .  however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good .  donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth .  the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles .  although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on .  although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity .  the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise .  most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie .  the 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students .  there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly .  if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp .  but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how .  the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes .  with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not .  i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film .  however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? '  a lot , and mike giggling like a loony .  there's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things .  the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all .  the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing .  also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation .  there are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one .  the blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver .  i suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods .  apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull .  the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide .  although a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience .  it's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com   ) is better than the film .

"" super mario bros . , "" "" street fighter "" and "" mortal kombat "" were silly stinkers all , and now the empty , execrable "" wing commander "" joins their lowly ranks .  enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci-fi , easily the worst of its kind , is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes - that is to say , there's little fun to be had when you're not the one holding the joystick .  the movie , then , is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts , who created the original , groundbreaking pc incarnation of "" wing commander "" back in 1990 .  how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a head-scratcher .   "" wing commander "" 's story , credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney , is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas .  it rips off the finest films of its genre , top gun and , in one scene , even those spiffy "" stereoscopic freeze "" gap commercials .  set in 2654 , "" wing commander "" stars freddie prinze jr . as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him .  along the way , he plays kissy-face with his stoic superior ( saffron burrows ) at the new galaxy hangout where he's posted , comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his "" pilgrim "" heritage ( don't ask ) , and goes on a top-secret mission involving the "" jump coordinates "" ( what , no death star plans ? ) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi .  or something like that .  given the immensely confusing activity , it's hard to tell .  on the other hand , what's easy to see is that "" wing commander "" is a big old mess .  the lame dialogue strains , filled with such original lines as "" don't you die on me ! "" ,   "" battle stations ! ""  and repeated ( and frequently unanswered ) calls for a "" medic ! ""  action sequences fizzle .  the character conflict garners unintentional giggles .  the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like , as they're kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes .  imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a ? 50s roger corman cheapie and you've got a good idea .  little but techno-babble happens for an hour , and then it's as if "" wing commander "" tries to do too much at once ; when it appears as though the movie's about to show signs of a pulse , it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before .  matthew lillard , featured prominently in said sequence , is cast as prinze's hotshot partner , and though the two are fine young actors - recently paired in the hit "" she's all that "" - they're fighting more than otherworldly evil here .  rumor has it that "" wing commander "" was slated as a later-in-the-year release , bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new "" star wars : episode i "" trailer .  but in my audience , there were no females present to make goo-goo eyes at prinze or lillard , and many a member exited after the much-ballyhooed sneak peek .  since most cineplexes won't be granting refunds to the latter contingency , "" commander "" might rake in some dough , but be warned : the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation .

"ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .  these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .  if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .  hackers is guilty of all of these crimes .  to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore .  those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled "" goofs "" .  this is the section for mistakes in the movies .  well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : "" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology "" .  and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct .  the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking .  more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller .  miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers .  the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems .  he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old .  the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer .  dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi .  oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film .  really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said .  it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi .  thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do .  this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list .  to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film .  if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers .  although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users .  hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time .

"in "" the astronaut's wife , "" charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly .  if only her name wasn't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : "" rosemary's species . ""  what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in "" the devil's advocate "" - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory .  ok , maybe "" the astronaut's wife "" deviates from "" rosemary's baby "" turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man .  predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great "" bowfinger "" line about "" alien love .

"every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed .  most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings .  but , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons .  i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review .  the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it .  which surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show .  such things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself .  the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) .  two of them are assigned to cover the train collision .  as soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other .  the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn .  movie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts .  however , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest .  it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers .  shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable .  the end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again .  i'll give it the benefit of the doubt , though .

"i am continually amazed at movies like this .  that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays .   "" wild wild west "" is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault .  in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs .  so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal .  the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring .  will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character .  west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach .  talk about deeply developed characters .  at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny .  the year is 1869 .  several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) .  president grant sends west and gordon to investigate .  there's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana .  west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate .  as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states .  i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't any point .  this film's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess .  i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly .  there isn't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that's pretty disasterous when you consider that it's primarily a comedy .  as i said , the fault is totally that of the script .  when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done .  the leads could've been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would've been awful .  no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like "" bye bye , mr . knife guy ! ""  sound good .  still , this film has a lot going for it visually .  the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy .  the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese's brilliant "" goodfellas "" ) , is absolutely stunning .  he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look .  i won't fault barry sonnenfeld either .  he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really isn't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw .  despite being beautifully made , "" wild wild west "" becomes quite boring after the half-way point .  the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does .  if "" wild wild west "" didn't look so good , it would be almost insufferable .  as it is , it's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining .  it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there isn't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy .

"plot : lara croft is british , rich and kicks a lot of ass .  she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years , and that lara holds the key to time , well , needless to say , they want to nab it from her .  oh yeah , lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts . . . hummana-hummana-hummana . . .  critique : angelina jolie was great in this movie .  there were also about three "" action scenes "" that were pretty cool to look at in this film .  uhhhhhm , unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked !  bad dialogue , generic sidekicks and bad guys , a lame mystery , yoda-esque moments with mumbo-jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end .  all in all , this movie wasn't the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about , especially since every other scene does feature jolie's torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts , but it was quite the letdown nonetheless , especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool , hip woman hero , based on a popular video game .  i don't know , i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west , who didn't really tie the whole movie together all that well .  the film lacked energy , a consistent pace and well . . . a  fun time !  i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie .  all that "" father "" crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing ( and i'm not even gonna mention his moustache . . . hehehe ) .  why have this shite in the movie at all ? ! ?  i especially hated the scenes in which some ghost-like figure , friend or child would ramble on about lara croft's father while all the time , i'm not giving one ounce of crap as to what they're talking about .  i guess that's called lack of "" character development "" , right ?  that's when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen , so that we could actually "" get into "" it and care about them .  i didn't care about anyone in this movie , and was bored during most of its "" let's explain why we're doing all this gobbledygook "" moments .  and even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass ( damn , did she look sexy blasting those guns or what ? ! ? ) , everybody else around her was so goddamn boring !  her butler was a throwaway with no personality , her side-kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word "" bugger "" ( and he says it a lot , trust me ! ) and all of the so-called bad guys just spewed one-dimension !  they had no spark , no energy amongst them , and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool ( see the trailer and you'll know which ones i'm talking about ) , the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull-crap just buried it even further .  also , for a movie that's supposed to be about all of these exotic locations , i wasn't necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots , and even less so with its interiors , which all looked like they were shot in the same room .  mind you , i won't go as far as to say that it's the "" worst movie of the year "" ( remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr . movies also ! ) , but it's definitely the worst film that i've seen during this summer movie season ( of course , it's still early and i'm sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike ) .  skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead . . . trust  me , you'll miss the boobs but end your night with some rock-solid porn and it's all good !  where's joblo coming from ?  raiders of the lost ark ( 10/10 ) - the mummy ( 8/10 ) - lost in space ( 7/10 ) - the mummy returns ( 6/10 ) - the general's daughter ( 3/10 ) - romancing the stone ( 7/10 ) - wild wild west ( 3/10 ) - mission impossible 2 ( 7/10 )  ",0
"over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing .  partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo .  a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr .  as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world .  thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 .  now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run .  in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms .  when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states .  meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter .  she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break .  of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place .  together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla .  with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla .  he didn't .  right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history .  the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down .  the script , however , is painfully bad .  it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl . ""  i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well .  why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ?  why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ?  why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ?  why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ?  okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll .  broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way .  hank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage .  like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color .  what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting .  casting must have been asleep on this one .  the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past .  although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable .  unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities .  the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it .  this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess .  most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously .  although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ?  if we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them .  godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be .  far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city !  there's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i .  joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time .  in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire .  none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers .  it's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie .  consider another punch pulled .  through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently .  it made me want to gag .  emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film .  with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more .  however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work .  now if they only had raymond burr . . . .

"because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy !  at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources !  the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of "" the x-files . ""  bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident .  at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant .  grace gets elizabeth's heart , and it leads her to bob .  it's the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people .  four writers are credited with contributing to the story .  that doesn't seem possible .  despite being a solid two hours long , "" return to me "" adds little to the "" boy meets girl / boy loses girl "" formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving .  duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along .  since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny .  he's out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i've always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on "" the x-files "" comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) .  there's something about duchovny that makes me uneasy .  regardless of the role he's playing , he comes off as a weirdo .  the only redeeming quality of "" return to me "" is its hilarious supporting cast .  the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie .  carroll o'connor is grace's grandfather marty o'reilly .  when bob comes into marty's restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status .  when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , "" this is bob !  his wife is dead ! ""  the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news .  also funny : bonnie hunt as grace's best friend megan and james belushi as megan's husband joe .  married with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance .  although it's rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill .  rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob's best friend and robert loggia as marty's brother-in-law angelo .  in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast .  bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o'connor and james belushi .

"you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year .  they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) .  combine that with howie long's first starring action role , and you've got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn't a very good film .  howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) .  in the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire .  william forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak .  he ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby .  his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him .  soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters .  why canadian ?  who knows , eh ?  along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage .  enter howie long .  he's called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of "" ground pounders "" , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help .  when he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage .  long's acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much .  although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he's a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better .  the script doesn't help him out any , however .  all too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny .  the dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable .  long's co-stars are a mixed bag .  at least they're all comfortable in their respective roles .  forsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn't seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) .  suzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn't given much more to do .  some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland .  you'd think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals .  that's not the case .  there's a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences . . . we've  seen this stuff before .  it's not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996's debut , bio-dome ) .  however , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were .  in fact , there's a good chance that some of them are still playing near you . . .

"late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an "" artificial conversation "" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) .  the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy .  the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial .  filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster .  prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed .  at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how "" cute "" it can be .  the happy couple "" psychoanalyze "" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love .  then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart .  why ?  well , because they have to .  otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after .  down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic .  scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead .  a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat .  the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well .  stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) .  he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film .  you know , the average porn star .  the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes .  she is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted .  attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up .  these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes .  what happened here ?  the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) .  writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off .  in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences .  the direction is film-school-grad obvious .  it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of "" cops , "" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion .  plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera .  this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that .  if he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so lucky .

" "" love to kill "" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes .  at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman .  danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his .  everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs .  much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another .  sound confusing ?  it is .  i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity .  in some respects , it works .  but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess .  characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen .  the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister .  but so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them .  well , i didn't , at least .  one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza .  here's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing .  here , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it .  i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona .  michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him .  like i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline .

"tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse .  the fugitive ?  not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had .  there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ?  oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man .  both movies are on video .  make the wise choice and pick the fugitive .  there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable .  while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice .  learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary .  when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail .  director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son .  every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture .  in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something .  all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend "" i miss my son . ""  nothing more , nothing less .  dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself .  libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough .  ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones .  winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles .  people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right .  though i don't think he will win another oscar again .  the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons .  even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count .  burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups .  the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime .  hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent .  that would just be plain stupid .

"when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store .  masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read .  of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history .  given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of "" trillions "" and make a live-action masters movie .  let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie .  the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible .  it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars .  we have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that "" deja vu "" is too polite a term to use in describing it .   "" blatant uninspired ripoff "" would appear more appropriate .  tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either .  so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ?  yes , there is .  one incredible good reason .  his name is frank langella .  langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years .  here he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece .  dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper .  given this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision .  skeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right .  masters of the universe .  i remember loving it when i was eleven .  at twenty one it's difficult to see why .  but , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder .  besides , this year marks the film's 10th anniversary .  watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate .

"written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni  directed by terry gilliam  i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid .  dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last .  then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose .  mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing .  acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy .  my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie .  full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out .  but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag .  fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 .  operating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr .  gonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers .  they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them .  duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge .  dr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax .  and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead .  that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view .  thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document .  it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die .  pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy .  it's a cheech and chong movie .  you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down .  there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard .  this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes .  there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen .  but to what end ?  much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations .  but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work .  this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong .  depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue .  in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost .  watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see .  it's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over .  as much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice .  sid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film .  gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose .  what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ?  it doesn't try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedy .  if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film .  but i don't want to be too hard on it .  there are some truly funny moments , and if you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it .  i do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect .

"the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society , ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , ' gets me every time .  unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film , `patch adams , ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact .  from the surface `patch adams' looks very promising .  it's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people .  when the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital .  in a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it's here that he finds how much he loves working with people .  so he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school .  right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable .  he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry .  shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) .  they , along with patch's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people .  once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can't graduate and kicks him out of school .  patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court .  it's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor .  i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it .  it seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie .  considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother .  not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama .  robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels .  but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams' is barely average .

"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat .  so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) .  my , how easily does the worm turn .  hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics .  at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included .  and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . .  boring .  although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness .  _54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .  these characters are about as generic as those descriptions .  in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat .  with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) .  as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ .  what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ?  even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene .  dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault .  from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend .  but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film .  aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .  shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .  this tacked-on "" romance "" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .  they fail on both counts .  ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n .  as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience .  too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .  anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .  when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) .  strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .  there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them .  they're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 .  these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made .  the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .

"it seems like i'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now .  scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the "" relentless "" department .  i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects , but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend , it's citizen hook .  jennifer love-hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by . . . waking  up .  she lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman-victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals .  paranoid and beat , she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla ( norwood ) , winner of the local radio station's 4th of july getaway giveaway .  bikini-ready julie invites boyfriend ray ( prinze , jr . ) , who-and here's the movie's biggest mystery-turns her down , but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take-off .  until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell-liner himself , that is .  unaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla's boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy-next-door type who's sweet on julie .  to make a long story short-i can't believe it took a paragraph to describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster .  not only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one-by-one , but the karaoke machine isn't working properly !   ( you think killing is hard ?  try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor's "" i will survive "" now contains the lyric "" i still know what you did last summer !

( i don't think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer . )  director cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here's my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won't rely on so many shock notes .  and let that person run wild with the camera .

"there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr .  magoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' .  it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie .  the film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me .  loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong .  after escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty .  he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands .  a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down .  he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere .  now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying .  a film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ?  the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some .  it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that .  some of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' .  come on people get some new ideas already !  what's even worse is that the film has no plot at all .  well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen .  'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film .  it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie .  even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours .

"you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the "" odd couple ii "" sneak preview .  they were as happy a group of men as i've ever encountered .

""   "" yeah , "" laughed a man standing next to him , "" i drive as slow as that one guy did .  my kids give me holy hell for it !

""  still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch .  matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons .  lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of "" phnah !  phnah ! ""  despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together .  unfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom .  one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club .  if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements .  burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot .  between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs .  i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing .  i came up with four "" god-damns , "" three "" shitheads "" and two "" fucks . ""  the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word .  it's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise .  one running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held .  at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word "" san . ""  the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing .  one of the oldest maxims of film-going is "" beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . ""   "" neil simon's the odd couple ii "" is no exception to the rule .  while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater .  of course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my "" young-whippersnapper "" ass to boot .  one thing's for sure , though .  they'll never catch me in a car chase .

"all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands .  thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away .  your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon .  it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised "" featuring the music of . . .

"warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes  director : luis mandoki  screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks )  cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage .  review by : geoff berkshire  i'm not an overly cynical guy .  there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years .  however , i have my limits and i also have standards .  this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day .  the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) .  during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean .  the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her .  upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) .  it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down .  he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing .  this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship .  of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) .  this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened .  the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film .  there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending .  a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel .  the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . .  well , since costner's the postman ( 1997 ) .  message in a bottle is one slow moving film .  last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this .  they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work .  message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly .  costner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring .  they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry .  the supporting players are given very little to do .  the reliable douglas is particularly wasted .  old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film .  a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played .  however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are .  the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story .  gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here .  caleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful .  do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ?  the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times .  the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego .  working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times .  its strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) .  there simply isn't an original scene in this film .  the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking .  this is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance .  he's simply going through the motions with this .  message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade .

"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years .  i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight .  the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show .  when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt .  i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back .  when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv .  king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king .  after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view .  gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin .  yes , i do . . .  1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans .  he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously .  he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously .  i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 !  i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has .  2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title .  this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in .  eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart .  3 .  the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him .  no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today !  4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ?  i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end .  5 .  in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan .  what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair .  wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ?  i hate that .  6 .  last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either .  the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons :  1 . they're the better promotion .  2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers .  3 .  they give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots .  4 . they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about .  5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way .  the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end .  and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .

"like a good action film should , "" metro "" has action that keeps you involved .  some action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts .   "" the ghost in the darkness , "" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep .  but "" metro "" is one of the best action films in a while .  it is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy .  eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while .  and this invites me to mention last year s "" the nutty professor , "" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be .   "" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series .  that is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun .  eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people .  the "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch .  in "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble .  his character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously .  eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way .  murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator .  in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up .  murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor .  the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim .   "" metro "" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car .  cars flip .  cars crash .  cars turn over .  and it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of "" speed , "" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons .  there are also some other good scenes in "" metro "" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have .  scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning .  of course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling .  the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too .  those are the scenes that make up "" metro , "" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality .  the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in "" metro "" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation .  it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius .  rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit .  i hardly recognized him in "" metro , "" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more .  there are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices .  the villain in "" metro "" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless .  he is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take .  wincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in "" kiss of death . ""  and , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list .  i liked "" metro , "" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy .  his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family .   "" metro "" is a no-nonsense movie .  it works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay .  it works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay .  it works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay .  and it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out .  but who cares ?  it still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself .  oh , and there were plenty of explosions in "" metro , "" as well .  how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those .  if there is one major objection i had to "" metro "" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes .   "" metro "" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end .  paul haynes "" >  ",0
"joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory .  the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it .  it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles .  but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . .  if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original .  unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid .  the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work .  this opening sequence is very boring and slow .  it shows joe walking to his office .  but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting .  a sequence like this should take 2 minutes .  here , it takes over 5 . . .  it is obvious that joe hates his job .  at his office , one of his co-workers is meg ryan .  oddly enough , she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! !  joe leaves to go to a doctor's appointment .  his doctor informs him that he has a "" brain cloud .

"1 . he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2 . he doesn't always speak in a monotone , and 3 .  his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression .  in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good .  unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful .  one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery .  as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers .  unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy .  to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture .  firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot .  the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively .  we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people .  during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive .  flash-forward a year .  now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) .  but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual .  a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom .  led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border .  along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) .  eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy .  firestorm's director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it's no surprise that the film looks good .  unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen .  these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game .  the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating .  everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions .  there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat .  as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache .  he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero .  my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume .  there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list .   ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . )  and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie .  as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments .  the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool .  the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm .

"certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ?  expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible .  in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison .  watching glen or glenda ?  i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious .  the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . ""  the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose .  wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , "" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . ""  finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , "" people .   .   .  all with their own thoughts .   .   .  their own ideas .   .   .   . ""  while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead .  had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ?  probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch .  unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script .   "" pull the string !  pull the string ! ""  announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears .  there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , "" beware .   .   .  beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door !   .   .   .  it eats little boys .   .   .  and puppy dogs' tails .   .   .  and big fat snails ! ""  a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room .  someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister "" green dragon "" ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) .  near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music .  after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ?  returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone .  the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened .  as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ?  had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen .  i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ?  for sheer cinematic disaster .  i am giving this movie an f , but i'm not sure that quite does it justice .

"i have a great idea for a movie , one that can't miss .  see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances .  it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity .  as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually .  i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with .  maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too .  eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind .  twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort .  eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required .  whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die-hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team .  coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount .  the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team .  the winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach .  the knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops .  incidentally , the knicks eventually start winning .  please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants .  awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do .  those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic .  those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing .  eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players .  this finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players ) .  perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick .  steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , "" don't blame me , i just work here . ""  perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while .  among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas .  and those are the real jokes in eddie .  nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , "" hey , it's donald trump ! ""  or "" hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! ""  it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right .  the knicks coach who is eddie's antagonist early in the film reappears at the end , but he isn't given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs .  neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of .  that leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help .  eddie isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise .  it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy .

"synopsis : a maniac , crazed by virulent microphage , slaughters more than twenty people , including a street gang and heavily-armed troops , with a small knife .  even with a handgun , however , he can't take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times .  comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge .  not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses .  this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess ) .  henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey .   ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . )  how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me .  adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) .  boston has changed dramatically in those ten years .  it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with "" policia "" printed on their doors .  some guy has a really bad virus , and he's killing people because of it .  so , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him .  that's it .  76 minutes never seemed so long .  this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie .  the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character .  the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight .  a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston .  in her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son .  twenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot .  in a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind .  this fake passport drops to the ground .  lambert's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away .  must not have been a good fake .  this emphasizes another fault with the film .  things just defy common sense .  lambert's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about .  adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for .  i found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert .  don't fear the rush .  fear the movie .  watch something else .

""  so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc .  this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit .  in fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie .  so for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a  heart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise .  not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort .  there are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them .  and for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) .  but the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ?  the answer is a resounding no .  it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy .  he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural , likable screen presence .  he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) .  still , macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has .  the late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance .  saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time .  the film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement .  come to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ .

"the crown jewel of 1970's irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship .  the story begins on the u . s . s .  poseidon's big new year's cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive .  let's see , there's the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to "" pray to that part of god within yourself . ""  there's the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her .  there's the hippie singer ( "" there's got to be a morning after . . . "" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed .  and to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall .  we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship .  everyone's in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down .  the second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship .  in this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom .  or is the bottom the top ?  either way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees .  thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them .  it's a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting .  the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes .  the one note in borgnine's one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn't a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they'll live to see their grandson's birth .  shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along .  winters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her "" fatass "" in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose .   "" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , "" she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she's swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? )  ridden thighs .  it's not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole .

"capsule : liebes meets tod .  this was a film about sex and death .  a morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies .  this film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and death , but imparts no insights .  to make matter worse this print was poorly subtitled into english from french .  0 ( -4 to +4 )  - an attractive 18-year-old dies on a disco floor and gets sent to a morgue .  one of the attendants , ben ( jean-marc barr ) is so attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia .  we see him crawling away after a shock .  in the middle of sex the dead teen has come back to life .  - the morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his collection of kinks .  he was already part of a group that gets together for s/m sex .  the revived teen , teresa ( elodie bouchez ) joins them .  - moral dilemma of teresa's father .  ben has abused his daughter's body , but in doing so has saved her life .  - part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins in the sexual hijinx .  also involved is a man in the final stages of dying of aids , a close friend of the morgue attendant .  he does not get involved in the orgies .  - the subtitles of our print were white , often on a white background making them often hard to read , but i don't think there was a whole lot of meaning there that was lost .  - the title means "" don't let me die on a sunday .

"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell .  the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films .  in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous .  with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions .  such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results .  now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai .  unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms .  the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking .  enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) .  kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family .  a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down .  it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends .  the following morning po sing is found dead .  suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder .  his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture .  issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter .  the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder .  he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined .  hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work .  escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death .   "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film .  it is both absurd and assured .  the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather "" .  the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another .  their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history .  the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable .  li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination .  allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace .  it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic .  but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it .  delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film .  an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance .  the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin .  the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in .  an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written .  first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film .  having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good .  but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes .  the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in .  the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing .  and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever .  the best things about the film are its fight scenes .  jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles .  one needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat .  here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that "" lethal weapon 4 "" ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow .  unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision .  also "" romeo must die "" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent .  obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's "" streetfighter "" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film .  it's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted .  one problem though about the fight scenes .  those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon .  they do have an internal rhythm to them .  a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography .  the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance .  this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing .  here in "" romeo must die "" , there is no staccato .  every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern .  the rhythm is monotonous .  a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact .  'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever .  a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . .  watch the restaurant fight from the film "" rush hour "" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) .  now look at the warehouse fight from "" rumble in the bronx "" .  there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath .  the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted .  here in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl .  jet li is a grand and personable screen presence .  it's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here .  one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity .  until then , we'll be left with emotionally hollow product like "" the replacement killer "" and , currently "" romeo must die "" .

"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us .  just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? ""  i'm wondering the same thing .  i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city . ""  it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't .  i just didn't .  surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ?  no , but i expected something .  a funny joke .  a clever prank .  a plot development .  anything .  the movie never delivers .  you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing .   "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization .  the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan .  that's it .  there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot .  the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) .  they have a garage band .  they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them .  they have tickets , they lose them .  they get more tickets , they lose those too .  they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire .  there's not much more to it .  frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity .  oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency .  she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already .  it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this .  we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy .  then again , "" maximum overdrive "" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time .   "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close .  in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind .  basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's "" highway to hell "" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) .  it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie .  edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood .  people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song .  too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess .  director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning .  we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script .  it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting .  i would recommend that those who felt seasick at "" the blair witch project "" stay far away from "" detroit rock city , "" because the witch has got nothing on this baby .  i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since "" armageddon . ""  and what about that script ?  it's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard .  if it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible .  a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny .  the jokes in "" detroit rock city "" rarely are .  in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal .  the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it "" comedy . ""  there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up .  it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , "" see ?  funny ! ""  look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink .  see ?  funny !  look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver .  twice .  see ?  funny !  look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money .  see ?  funny !  a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves .  they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance .  that's it , i've said enough about this movie .  it's a waste of time and money .  i liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack .  i hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie .  you want to see this concept executed well ?  go rent roger corman's 1979 classic "" rock n' roll high school . ""  it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show .  yes , go rent that , and skip "" detroit rock city , "" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .

"capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie .  presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock .  i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art .  no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already .  i thought : it's about these two cops .  and they're buddies , sort of .  they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other .  and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots .  and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship .  and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying .  and the bad guy is a drug lord .  and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way .  and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down .  i only missed the bit about the badges .  the rest i got dead-on .  and i hadn't even left the video store yet .  the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo .  smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds .  this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's "" not getting any "" , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's "" back door man "" .  not funny ; tiresome .  bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence .  will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . .  and men in black .  he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself .  martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial .  movies like this are not about originality .  i know this .  they are about style and energy and synergy between actors .  i know this , too .  and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up .  i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix .  bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified .  i could write this movie .  you could write this movie .  many people have .  many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again .  other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it .  more the fools we all .  in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly , phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange .  one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other .  the same could be said about this movie .  i have the sinking feeling we're going to see it again .  soon .

"after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash .  maybe not !  mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether .  tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it .  the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts .  stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money .  in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits .  the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names .  tango & cash is unbearably noisy .  for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes .  to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier .  in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases .  there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie .  screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv .  his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual .  in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier .  it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , "" i want to be in this movie . ""  the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting .  feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable .  they simply could have called it "" action movie . ""  every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies .  adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon .  action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism .  the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography .  there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires .  the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell .  unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants .  the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing .  it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure .  tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes .  seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials .  furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence .  machine guns and torture generally don't mix well with comedy .  jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain .  his character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice .  like many movie villains , palance likes to play games .  in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room .  you have to wonder why palance doesn't just shoot the detectives in the head !  the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent .  teri hatcher plays stallone's sister and russell's love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be .  but regrettably , hatcher's acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty .  every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination .  there's really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film .  and , more to the point , tango definitely isn't worth a penny of your cash--so don't bother .

" "" something is fishy in the state of universal . ""  about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies .  we've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on .  to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward "" haircuts "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim .  most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane .   ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . )  now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter .   ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea . )  the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script .  the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through .  in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now .  the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet .  the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy .  somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis .  enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back .  we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical "" dryland , "" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola .  the psycho ruler of the smokers , the "" deacon , "" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland .  played with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing .  his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny .  the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner .  he's playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the "" mariner , "" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet .  very little is done with this .  the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth's surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown .   ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it's more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . )  i'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves .  but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it !  this movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there's * nothing * in it we haven't seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey .  at 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make .  the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx .  in sum , this movie is beneath contempt .  it has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation .  if you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee .  otherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks .

" "" party camp , "" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i've seen in awhile .  a late rip-off of the "" meatballs "" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk .  that's really about all that can be said about the "" plot "" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax .  how fun !  since , "" party camp , "" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative .  it's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex .  even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick .  at least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through .  never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat .  the comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn't the least bit funny .  it was groan-inducing .  constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything .  so what saves , "" party camp , "" from the dreaded zero star rating ?  well , that's simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch .  although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy .

"if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality .  here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves .  swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless .  alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up .  what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter .  my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here ) .  it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience .  maybe it will work for some people .  it didn't work for me .  billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania .  he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film .  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall .  his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size .  subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago .  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins .  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved .  sam is broke .  max is dying .  pass the kleenex .  my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny .  it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself .  in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) .  crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes .  muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well .  quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents .  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff .  here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent .  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre .  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings .  sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) .  later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family .  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) .  it's icky .  it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions .  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film .  more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is .  instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears .  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world .

"what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie ?  a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ?  if you have an answer , let me know .  foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw-droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming value socially , cinematically or otherwise .  comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand-up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for .  master p stars as fifty dollah' ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) .  but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert's "" idiot plot , "" if everyone here wasn't an idiot , there would be no problem )  so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ?  not a hell of a lot .  as i have mentioned , master p cannot act or write .  he acts like the rapper that he is .  the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro .  as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience .  if you haven't yet figured it out , that is not saying much .  co-star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story .  the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand-up and otherwise .  he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips .  he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie .  and indeed , i laughed at a few stand-up scenes here , but from a feature-length movie i expect more .  foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters .  every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry-sporting sibling "" you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush "" ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion "" huh ?

"this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash .  this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life .  yes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department .  it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives .  and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty .  although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way .  this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there .  the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money .  they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance .  commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful .  bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems .  fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath .  it's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers .

"robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein .  mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit .  unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world .  it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce .  the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves .  this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie .  mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on .  the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice .  cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard .  he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis .  he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil "" sheriff of rottingham "" .  a good adventure plot that is sadly unused .  elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating .  neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable .  perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone .  this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre .  much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre .  chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from "" rent-a-wreck "" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever .  scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting .  perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive .  the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny .  mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) .  the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails .  the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive .  the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard .  he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting .  if you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film .

"starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way .  now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel .  the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either .  fast forward to the late '80's .  steve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) .  nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role .  that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter .  the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original .  the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets .  it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets .  the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's .  unlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap .  one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith .  she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars .  in terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky .  seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite .  anyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans .  the more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets .  and it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either .  anyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it .  not really , but that is how it seems .  this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original .  as i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy .  in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness .  although , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon .  the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud .  although some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows .  it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible .  sadly , it doesn't work very well .  if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original .   ( although that isn't so hot either . )  this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities .  ",0
"well , here's a distasteful , thoroughly amateurish item that , surprisingly , was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release .  after just viewing the film for the first time , my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ?  it is cheap , idiotic , unfunny , and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was .  at least some smut would have livened things up a bit .   "" porky's , "" tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid .  women , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ) .  their plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky's , which they are able to get into using fake id's .  after they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building .  for these four teenage guys , this means war on porky's .   "" porky's , "" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level .  as a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough .  as a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat .  as a look back at the 1950's , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave .  and as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore .  one of the most offensive things about , "" porky's , "" is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers .  the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool .  that sure is revealing information .  the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark .  the women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people .  for example , the two gym teachers , mrs . balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of .  mrs . balbricker is a gruff , no-holds-barred , overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness , and , in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved , honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog .  there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny , only humiliating .  to prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is , compare it to other more serious 80's films about teenagers , and it looks even worse in comaprison .  any of the john hughes pictures , such as 1984's "" sixteen candles , "" or , 1985's "" the breakfast club , "" put , "" porky's , "" at an even greater shame .  those films actually dealt with serious teen matters , but remained a great deal funnier , thanks to their bright and truthful writing .  and heck , if , "" porky's , "" wanted to be a teenage sex movie , i'd take 1982's "" fast times at ridgemont high , "" or 1982's "" the last american virgin , "" over this any day of the week .  director bob clark is not a bad director .  two years after he made , "" porky's , "" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic , "" a christmas story . ""  i would forgive him for this misfire , in fact , if it wasn't for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay .  just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage , and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world , is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in , "" porky's .

"synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall .  comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it .  strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) .  strike two came while the previews played .  did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ?  well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) .  tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout .  about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery .  to be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller .  wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title .  james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten .  brolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company .  by the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious .  apparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city .  but , then again , what do i know about business ?  i do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch .  larson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill .  this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it .  the film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game .  larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help .  some old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film .  the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two .  outside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious .  if you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't .  make tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery .

"midway through "" anaconda "" , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says "" i thought this movie would be my first big break .  instead , it's turned into a disaster . ""  truer words have never been spoken .   "" anaconda "" is a monster movie with a lousy monster .  it's a suspense film that is utterly predictable .  it's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box .  as you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens .  the main difference between the giant snake in "" anaconda "" and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic .   "" anaconda "" boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years .  animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world .  but it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame .  in one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air .  the scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper .  here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon .  what's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie .  but enough about the phony snakes .  now it's time to talk about the lousy story .  heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest .  stoltz tells his crew "" pray that you didn't forget your bug spray . ""  apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect .  along the way , the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama .  within minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness .  from that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from "" jaws "" and "" dead calm . ""  one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz .  early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious .  so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ?  also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ?  ah , the mysteries of hollywood .  the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen .  jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters .  lopez , who starred in "" selena , "" is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible .  ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously .  there's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he's gently mocking his own tough-guy posturing .  but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight .  obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of "" jonny quest . ""  at one point , he looms over the crew and says "" the anaconda is the perfect killing machine .  it strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love .  and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode .

"forget get carter .  instead . . .  get me a cup of coffee .  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?  when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads .  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city .  get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .  a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey .  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .  too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges .  get carter is a simple story .  stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) .  when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter's way "" .  he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee .  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough .  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .  what a minute !  this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey .  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .  actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) .  while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose .  throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously .  his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character .  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character .  he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book .  get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .  the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .  never mind that it should never have been made at all .

"here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter .  these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen .  that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags .  observe the opening sequence .  a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) .  they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles .  however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut .  he is undecided .  this happens for about 10 seconds .  the audience finds some humor in his foolishness .  the lights suddenly go out .  cisco is surprised and says : "" whoa . . . let's  go ! ""  and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence .  the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film .  needing cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi .  however , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco's and melvin's boss .  infuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping .  during his 'investigation' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution .  melvin must now find a way to stay alive .  by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ?  cisco's partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing .  but , mr . nishi has a trace buster buster .  to counter that , cisco's partner has a trace buster buster buster .  but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster .  and so on . . .  there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live .  and there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about .  how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee ?  what goes on among this clique ?  why is cisco at odds with melvin ?  there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored , but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction , and instead we are given a not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners , silly sight gags , extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery .  and , i haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want them to separate , nor melvin's mistress , nor the pimple-faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on .  if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now .

"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film .  it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) .  the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting .  the story is very minimal and basic .  there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) .  they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming .  when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) .  gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans .  on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties .  sounds great huh , well it's not .  the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work .  the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds .  there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa .  the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back .  i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage .  they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor .  the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan .  mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw .  she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face .  now what didn't work in this movie ?  that would be the rest of it .  the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets .  the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road .  it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless .  the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way .  i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie .  the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set .  also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in .  i like wrestling .  i watch it at home and laugh .  it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it .  this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv .  the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew .  the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently .  the movie was too dim-witted to be funny .  it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever .  a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city .  that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film .  the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh .  now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads .  at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox .  he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good .  the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's "" bawitdaba "" and "" cowboy "" .  martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne .  script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin .  a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it .  at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real .  the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up .  it's utterly ridiculous .  the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience .  the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers .  the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie .  the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it .  if you're going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it's actually entertaining .  the wrestling is betters , they're funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes .  oh and the girls are hotter .  is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?  don't waste your money .

"i looked at the "" internet movie database "" 's awards section for this film , and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for "" best picture ( drama ) . ""  anyone who's seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the "" great "" disaster films , and that's not really saying a lot for this film .   "" earthquake "" is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured .  on video , it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster .  while this worked in , say , "" the towering inferno , "" it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters .  the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including "" skyjacked "" and that classic , "" soylent green "" ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his "" shaft "" thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) .  in smaller subplots , there's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a . ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who's playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ?  guess again . he gets interested in the final frames ) ; there's genieveve bujold's moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy , there's walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . . .  - the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who's big moment is a dance he does at a critical time .  as for the actual "" earthquake , "" it's rather a let-down .  there's a full hour of character-setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) .  this film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored .  there's little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it .  there's an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured .  but none of these are all-too suspenseful .  the finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which brings out a big let-down .  and there's no real finale .  even "" volcano "" ended nicely , and that movie really sucked .  not only is it hokey , but you don't care about any character .  who cares if heston dies ?  who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ?  who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid "" stunt ? ""  who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ?  and who cares about that whole plane spiel ?  if anything , "" earthquake "" is worth a viewing for the same reason "" glen or glenda ?

"porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years .  they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , "" town and country . ""   "" town and country "" has a pedigree befitting it's title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( "" the graduate "" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( "" funny bones "" ) .  after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty's next "" ishtar . ""  so , is it that bad ?  the answer is no .  but it's not very good either .  the major problem with "" town and country "" is that it's unstructured and random .  stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) .  next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin .  then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples' divorce lawyer ) .  ellie thinks she's overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family's mississippi manse .  the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they'd never become a couple to begin with .  back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter's cheating on her .  porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he's gay .  the four friends , along with every woman porter's dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after .  although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere .  the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , "" the virgin suicides "" and tricia vessey , "" kiss the girls "" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who's just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home .  after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son .  porter's romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled .  once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm .  while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused .  maybe we're supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn't initiate his own sex romps ?  keaton's ellie has a trusting nature that's a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character .  hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of "" the out of towners "" and "" the first wives' club "" while shandling's relegated to true second banana status .  kinski is bland and unmotivated .  andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay's most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother .  heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party .  oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like "" hear my song "" and "" funny bones . ""  the script is this film's weakest link - it's telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit .  while "" town and country "" isn't exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there .

"the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie , but , alas , no caped crusader descends to save * this * film .  instead , it's a skeletal housemaid ( julia roberts ) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of "" dr .  jekyll and mr . hyde . ""  for a few , fleeting , maddening moments , director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons ) gets everything just right-- the tone , the colors , the characters ; all the ingredients to make a most-powerful potion out of valerie martin's best-selling novel .  yet it fizzles too quickly ; the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene .  casting is a large part of the problem .  the story all but collap- ses around ms . roberts-- she doesn't have the range for this kind of drama .  her accent also comes and goes , though it's nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co-star john malkovich .   ( he looks the same in both of his roles-- an incredible fact that's missed by everyone in the story ! )  the very british supporting cast-- including michael gambon and george cole-- gives credibility to the smaller parts .  glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon .  her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and-- as a bonus-- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live-action 101 dalmantions .  the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense : there is none .  no terror , no tension ; nothing .  without any weight , wit , or wonder to propel the story , the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail , a few buckets of blood , and stuart craig's fabulously dreary production design .  all of which gets old after about an hour , at which point i recommend leaving .

"the previews for the movie are pretty good .  they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script .  unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes .  the residents of mystery love hockey .  mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football .  the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes . )  every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch .  the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated .  mystery's national fame has the town abuzz .  a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl .  the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals .  the mysterians see this as both good and bad .  on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition .  on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes .  the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition .  biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement .  he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife .  crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding .  charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth .  his "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater .  he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him .  burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans .  walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him .  he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it .  reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together .  one character actually was interesting .  biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey .  but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community .  she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open .  her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom .  mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning .  the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about .  instead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy .  they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride .  they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny .  they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about .  as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle .  the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about .  there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music .  it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important .  russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us .  he says that what really matters in life is "" community . . . . ""  then adds "" and hockey . ""  i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear .  only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars .  i even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places .  but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn't suit him .  myers is a comic character actor .  he puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny .  he's great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters .  nobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature .  all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles .  for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself .  it's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .   "" quick , robin !  the anti-shark repellant ! ""  - adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg  i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard .  this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill .  batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss .  by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast .  the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life .  meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) .  akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement .  it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison .  i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production .  joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance .  there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode .  another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons .  mr . schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective .  it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered .  is batman and robin supposed to be campy ?  i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously .   ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! ""  each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . )  is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ?  i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is .  arnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be .  mr . schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable .  by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen .  the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of "" cool ! ""  in the least inventive way .  george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film .  his batman is hardly an imposing figure .  chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all .  the film's one saving grace ?  undoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy .  her work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film .  ms . thurman's comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully .   ( i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever . )  her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers .  i figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a half-bad way to go .  while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat .  it's been a long time since i've laughed so much at a movie .   "" at "" , of course , is the operative word .  ",0
"it's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film .  that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression .  indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel .  the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians .  the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of "" collectible "" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas .  well , it's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it's digitally enhanced .  here's the story .  cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the "" cure "" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov .   ( oh , how witty . )  she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film .  cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again .  a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula .  at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater .  how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film's villain ) sunk in the film business ?  it's almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon .  and depardieu . . .  how can a french guy have a bad french accent ?  and never mind the toilet brush haircut .  the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he's a rottweiler .  now that's funny .

"synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion .  reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate .  comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies .  she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner .  the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title .  not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese .  it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating .  the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out .  the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel .  to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following .  i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother .  i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation .  if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity .  the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene .  a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . ,  tramps about in the woods .  with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered .  what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er ,  leggings ) .  tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well ,  as the earthquake slowly recedes .  a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven .  i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point .  this movie is really stupid .  it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief .  also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston .  the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four .  a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs .  she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories . ""  yep .  we get it .  we get it .  the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me .  the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing .  as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time .  the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt .  the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .  this movie also suffers from its new age trappings .  maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music .  add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious .  the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while .  it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity .  the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes .  the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear .  the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about .  although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people .  the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie .  however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality .  typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind .  the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) .  i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie .  i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . .

" "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year .  it has to be .  the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider .  bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand .  is it as bad as advertised ?  oh yes , very much so .  the plot is incomprehensible .  the acting is atrocious .  the special effects are mediocre .  the action is dull .  the implausibilities are legion .  the dialogue is cringe-inducing .  the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny .  i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is :  the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo .  the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved .  only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear .  one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos .  there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) .  pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back .  meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter .  he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous .   .   . )  so the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go .  terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself .  of course , his plan doesn't work .  so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ?  how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ?  early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? ""  the movie did nothing to stem such remarks .  all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo .  of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary .  the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees .   ( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not !  fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! "" )  it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot .  he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book .  he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter .   ( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra . )  not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology .   ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . )  he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him .  no wonder this guy never got his promotion .  the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention .  why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ?  how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ?  how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ?  and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ?  there's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in "" battlefield earth . ""  bring a scorecard to track the plot holes .  director roger christian shoots "" battlefield earth "" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason .  all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue .  the action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement .  are these things really so hard to construct ?  my respect for supposed "" lightweight "" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in "" battlefield earth "" how badly an action sequence can be shot .  this movie is an absolute headache .  it's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense .  for most of "" battlefield earth's "" running time , i just didn't know what was happening .  it didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on .  when i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better .  here's how much of a disaster this is : "" battlefield earth "" is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it .  the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it .  in fact , i'd think that hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible .  that'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again .

"birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives .  are we doing what we want to be doing ?  what happened to our dreams ?  with the new millennium , our collective big birthday , just around the corner , some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence .  the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren't doing it for many anymore and they're looking for something else .  we'll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years .  ricky hayman ( jeff goldblum ) is having a career crisis .  the programming director for the good buy home shopping network , he's going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically .  new producer kate newell ( kelly preston ) is supposed to whip things into shape .  when the two are fixing a flat , they almost run down new age pilgrim "" g "" ( murphy ) .  g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don't really want all that commercial crap .  in some unexplained manner , this causes sales to sour .  ricky is saved .  the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all .  it's not an over-the-top comedy or a heart-warming message of humanity .  it _is_ a mish-mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog .  i am willing to put up with preaching from a film , but the messages here are old hat .  you should take time to smell the roses .  selling your soul for cash is a bad idea .  golly .  i'm glad i saw the movie .  i never would have thought of these .  the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed .  when g takes a chainsaw to the set , there's an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious .  it doesn't happen .  the bits are so subdued and overly-long that there's only a hint of laughter from the audience .  murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better .  there are hints of promise in this one .  the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved-headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen .  the others are horrendous .  goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career , but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his "" invasion of the body snatchers "" .  his relationship with kate makes no sense .  they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen .  preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be .  somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value .  an attempt to satirize stupid television , we get a self-parody instead .

"there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start .  recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much .  a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e . l . e . ) that wiped out the dinosaurs .  what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world .  firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid .  to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) .  mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted .   ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . )  it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives .  however , the film simply fails on that note .  the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials .  she's still making good money though .  t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast .  but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored .  robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) .  leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters .  warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) .  plot holes , plot holes , plot holes .  now , e . l . e .  is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ?  where's the logic ?  leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 .  and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims .  the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing .  i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start .  it's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter .  building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr .  strangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years .  now that is a more practical use for caves .  what is the point of living in caves ?  there is no , unlike `dr .  strangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure .  how do plants grow ?  if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open .  the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves .  obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media .  in an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres .  this is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact .  but even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it's still watchable , just don't think about it .  okay ?
