"wong kar-wei's "" fallen angels "" is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i've seen in a long while .  unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for .  ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of "" fallen angels "" , this is not so .  every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at .  wong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal "" knock off "" ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe .  ugh . )  the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives .  i can't say much more than that as i didn't really know what was going on most of the time .  in fact , it wasn't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character .  the constantly moving camera doesn't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character .  we're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters .   "" fallen angels "" is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level .  in fact , i'd go so far as to say that "" fallen angels "" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i've ever seen .  sure , there's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating .  but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images .  there were far too many instances during "" fallen angels "" in which i asked myself , "" now who are these people again ?  is this that first couple or the second couple ? ""  it was impossible to keep track .  perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with "" name cards "" , as in scorsese's "" mean streets "" .  that's really besides the point , though .  wong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that's he's a movie-maker to watch .  let's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies .

"there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video .  no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy .  nice guy ed norton jr . ( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead .  dad's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father .  dad was fighting a fire when they shot him .  now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart .  derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence .  at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare .  derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts .  when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch .  cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father .  he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings .  keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation .  derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes .  at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong .  one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for .  outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all .  the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded .  in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp .   ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r . what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? )  the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief .  derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down .  derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin .  now in prison , derek faces new challenges .  as the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me . ""  there is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy .  they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation .  derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid .  when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed .  without derek's leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture .  it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's screwed up .  in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny .  the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience .  edward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance .  although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton's performance compensated .   ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store . )  he also captured the essence of an older brother .  he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart .  though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring .  the subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at .  nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face .  kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture .

"an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material .  the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .  instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice .  upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days .  of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .  in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .  rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .  i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .  but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .  ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .  throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character .  the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .  director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .  the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .  the reason ?  mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .  the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .  unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone .  rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .  it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .  several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .  early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .  after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past .  it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any .  but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .  the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .  or if our passports weren't missing .

"when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better .  nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s .  for new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids .  for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for .  feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era .  martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all .  the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights .  the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world .  the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign .  their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre .  losing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street .  he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict .  that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi .  as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations .  for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times .  for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade .  brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .  his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence .  his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain .  however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen .  but despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against "" scum "" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it .  while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel .  wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he "" knows stuff "" .  his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .  other characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age .  matthew "" sport "" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture .  porno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly "" liberated "" betsy .  even the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless "" messages "" that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis .  the past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end .  travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen .  new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere .  another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture .  one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason .  instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie .  now , more than two decades later , when some other "" life imitating art "" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory .

"the rocky horror picture show 'special edition' ( 1975 )  starring : tim curry and susan sarandon  cult films are never mainstream .  the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out 'what the hell is that ? ' .  fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they're insane .  the rocky horror picture show , recently re-released in a 'special edition' to video , is the mother of all cult films .  period .  like some other cult films , most notably little shop of horrors , the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it .  this movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining .  they go to a castle to try to use the phone .  little do they know that the castle is owned by dr . frank n . furter , a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons .  the acting is pretty good overall .  tim curry ( home alone 2 , legend ) is over-the-top as frank n . furter .  it's interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon's ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet , the girlfriend of brad majors .  even the singer meatloaf is in it ! !  the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way .  a sampling of titles range from damn it , janet to touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me .  all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing .  barry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon , but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience .  meatloaf sings like meatloaf .  the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version .  sadly , the songs are tacked after the credits- kind of defeats the purpose .  if you want to see a different film , watch this one ! !

"you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it .  that's a bit more difficult .  the farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies .  if you're not nice to it , you lose .  galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned .   "" the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . ""  that is the current tagline of "" galaxy quest , "" a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns .  it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in "" galaxy quest "" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble .  jason nesmith ( tim allen ) played "" commander peter quincy taggart "" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do .  the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt .  dane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line "" by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged "" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans .  one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of "" galaxy quest "" followers .  they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia .  they have mistaken the "" galaxy quest "" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel .  the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) .  nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes .  next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship .  of course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them .  but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians .  i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked .  taking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody .  nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration .  the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub's fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek .  while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell "" i need more power down here captain ! "" ,  chen's cry for help is more to the tune of "" the core , like , won't take it or something . ""  it's a hoot , but it doesn't stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren't far behind .  galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .  by grabthar's hammer , this is a hell of a movie .

"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers .  the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters .  everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers .  although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride .  liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good .  the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good .  there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk .  the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life .  holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature .  askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious .  no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying .  he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it .  the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining .  also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance .  the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes .  it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better .  the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another .  also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky .  still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it .  it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag .  because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent .  unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus .  go is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters .  thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . )  they are who they are and they stay that way .  go is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers .  ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride .  erm , go to go , i guess .

"damn those trailers .  had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' .  as it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair .  marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach .  she takes a nap while he goes for a swim .  when marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found .  she contacts authorities , but they can't find him either .  did he disappear to start a new life ?  was he killed by accident ?  did he commit suicide ?  marie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers .  it's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit .  the film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing .  it's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles .  this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling .  rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional .  the scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking .  she can't quite get over him .  they've been married for twenty-five years .  the other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too .  the sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel .  likely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience .  while it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss .  ozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer .

"i don't know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn't this one .  the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring .  in my personal opinion , they couldn't be more wrong .  if you were expecting airplane ! -like  laughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment .  however , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see .  honest , it is .  this story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america's airwaves in 1939 .  penny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner's secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice , partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks .  among the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back .  unfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation .  while trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn .  mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i'm trying to be unbiased so i won't tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time .  along with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a .  law ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait .  the special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn't very difficult to do ) in many scenes .  although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie .  overall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use .  some comments collected from friends :  ",1
"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .  and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .  her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .  but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .  and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .  written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .  alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .  as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .  walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .  ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .  she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .  she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .  and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .  thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .  the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .  ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .  walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .  when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . ""  ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .  sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .  it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .  lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .  lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .  and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .  lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .  i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .  the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .  joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .  alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .  the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .  as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .  and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .

"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree .  both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers .  both relate the story of a couple liberated by love .  but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant .  where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological .  what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores .  what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill .  to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields .  for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed .  this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity .  brahma created .  vishnu preserved .  and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma .  the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics .  your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers .  i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena .  muslims kill christians .  hindus kill muslims .  christians kill pagans .  jews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged .  religion is an orgy of killing .  the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable .   "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc .  well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ?  let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex .  consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever .  god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other .  during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power .   ( parenthetically , witness plato as well .  in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime .  not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . )  catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil .  it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure .  masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution .  this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence .  as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters .  our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years .  we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self .  mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves .  it is a straightforward liberation through sex .  as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . ""  m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions .  they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions .   "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says .  as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face .  we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is .   "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us .  beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . .  we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth .  who else has found it ? --the  man of today ? -- "" i  don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in "" --so sighs the man of today . . . .  this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay .  this tolerance and largeur of the heart that "" forgives "" everything because it "" understands "" everything is a sirocco to us .  rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds !  as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say .  its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure .  for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , "" if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , "" in his most excellent bill and ted voice .  on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes .  it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it .  let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her "" the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! ""  now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this .  sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever .  it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey .  as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory .  she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory .  upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else .  the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power .  let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle .  the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood .  also , jungian archetypes abound .  these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames .  some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) :  mickey to mallory : "" one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , "" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off .  semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come .  at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet .  the two of course go hand in hand .  for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs .  mickey during his marriage to mallory : "" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . ""  the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too .  it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones .  this is what mickey means by "" creator of my universe , "" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes .  it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears .  scagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth .  the indian sage releasing mallory's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : "" old man , go be a snake , "" after telling his "" snake story "" that ends with "" bitch , you knew i was a snake . ""  after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , "" you killed life ! ! ! ""  this is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life .  then what were they killing up to that time ?  in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were .  in other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents .  the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison .  it of course symbolizes rebirth .  dr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : "" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don't give a damn . ""  this is reminiscent of nietzsche's whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil .  mickey : "" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . ""  mickey ( again in his interview ) : "" me and you , we are not the same species . ""  notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control .  mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang .  the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is .  mickey : how ya feelin' ?  wayne : fucking great !  mickey : you got the feelin' ?  wayne : i'm alive .  i'm alive for the first fuckin' time !  what an incredible transformation this is .  he got the feeling and he couldn't contain himself .  what a feeling .  that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe .  mickey when almost caught in a dead end , "" think , think , think , think . ""  go figure it out .  dwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film .  his whole attitude can be summed up with , "" destroy them ! ! ! ""  ",1
"there's good news and bad news about mulan .  the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules .  on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast .  but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king .  after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians .  mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married .  that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her .  cartoons . . .  meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns .  since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go .  she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family .  that's chinese culture for you . . .  so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place .  the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army .  it should have been called g . i .  chang .  mulan calls on her ancestors for help .  they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up .  voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges .  murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have .  you ain't never had a friend like mushu .  speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this .  disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go . . . "" ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable .  the best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song .  yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle .  sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes .  it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ?  i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage .  for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl .  all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china .  the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best .  but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster .  as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable .  i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name .  otherwise , mulan is a good movie .  the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots .  eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star .  hell , george "" mr . sulu "" takei does a voice in mulan .  you get the sense disney said to themselves , "" alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood .  who can you think of ? ""   "" well , there's mr . myagi . . . ""   "" good . ""   "" and mr . sulu . ""   "" perfect .  we've got ourselves a movie now .

"the happy bastard's quick movie review  analyze this  how does one do a comedy focused on the mob ?  well , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia !  failed to really get the joke .  this time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets more than it misses . . . and  for plenty of reasons .  the story goes like this .  a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting .  it's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two reasons .  first , of course , he's a mobster , but secondly , he's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid .  and , of course , he can't rest worth for a moment because the mobster's goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation .  fortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs .  director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which wasn't half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings can't always be taken for laughs , you know ) .  deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart .   ( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . )  crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character , uplifting him from such bombs as father's day and my giant .  kudrow is also a hoot as crystal's wife-to-be , who's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro's presence .  is the movie perfect ?  not really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he's a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy .  kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either .  line of the movie : crystal : "" when you said you needed family therapy , this is not the family i had in mind !

"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film .  it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time .   "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) .   "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children .  when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family .  sethe is proud , though , and will not move .  her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation .  a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging .  he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot .  when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil .  it's just sad . ""  some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears .  but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house .  her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills .  she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk .  they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down .   "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story .  most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts .  sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! ""  worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back .  she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone .  when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it .  she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing .  of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film .  beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long .  thus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system .  that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely .   "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable .  the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense .  sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey .  it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today . . . if  she was strictly an actress .  her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie .  emotion .  sadness .  strength .  watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great .  she makes it real .  that's not to say this is a perfect film .  in fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is .  while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film .  it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore .  but despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point .  the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality .  and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be .  jonathan demme's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters .  there's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism .  the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination .  everyone has been raving about thandie newton's performance , and how it should be rewarded .  however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part .  act like a baby .  throw things .  stumble around .  chew food with your mouth open .  i do think there's another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it's kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother's loss of reality towards the end .  it's not that newton isn't great : she's as annoying and wacky as the role demands .  it's just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better .  despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , "" beloved "" has still not done well .  costing , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two .  unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic "" caligula , "" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) .  although i respect "" beloved , "" i can't say that i really enjoyed it .

" "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen .  the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds .  then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score .  dah-dum .  from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .  right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip .  perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie .  he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .  unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .  until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .  he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .  he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .  the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .  the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .  brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .  hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying .  when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .  the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .   "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .  it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) .  even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age .  although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .  the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .  scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .  nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .  scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .   "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him .  dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .  however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .  bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .  he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .  however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .  quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .  indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .  his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .  shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .  of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .  a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat .  every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .  the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .  many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .  but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .

"bob the happy bastard's quickie review :  the mummy  brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . .  fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) .  it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in .  but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon .  fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground .  basically , it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress .  his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible .  of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j . o'connor ) and some "" americans "" . . . and  guess what ?  yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc .  fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold .  ok , so it's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough .  the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either .  the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well .  no , it's no phantom menace beater , but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy .  if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will .

"capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities .  mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness .  you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india .  the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable .   , low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala .  her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi .  a wealthy family is having a wedding .  an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial .  even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together .  the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines .  aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us .  she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor .  latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey .  dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration .  even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants .  several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both .  there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love .  some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films .  western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna .  on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films .  this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english .  the latter will , however , help with an international release .  sabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog .  we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference .  director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it , "" shall we dance "" won't be seen by that many people .  and that's a shame - this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences .  the surprising thing about "" shall we dance "" is the universal appeal of the story .  a us version is in the works , and it's no wonder - it's not really all that culture specific .  although there is a narrated set-up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn't at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film .  the only important unexplained japanese-specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you'll know why ) .  a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life ( a house , a child , and good marriage ) still doesn't translate into a fulfilled life .  after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work , sugiyana ( koji yakusho ) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself .  after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai ( tamiyo kusakari ) too rich for his blood , sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her .  we then meet the players in this gem of a movie , who all have their own reasons for joining the class .  later on , we meet aoki at the dance studio ( naoto takenaka ) , a co-worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film .  the story , laughs , and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along .  it's a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances .  it's difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much - the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters , and in the end , each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater .  it's one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore - no big plot , no special effects , no gunplay , no tragic consequences , no forced examinations of the nature of love , and no insights into the nature of evil .  just a warm , funny , endearing film that will charm the pants off of you .  when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside ?   "" shall we dance "" will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste .  ",1
"one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length .  if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap .  but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent .  boogie nights falls into the latter catagory .  the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along .  mark whalberg , a . k . a  marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area .  jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business .  after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies .  in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script .  we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband .  but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing .  the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up .  there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches .  the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . )  boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 )  the soundtrack is also excellent .  like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift .  also , the costumes are great .  the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties .  the film , although excellent , does have some flaws .  firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry .  in both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost .  but the rest of the cast are excellent .  burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . )  another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on .  it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly .  it's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced .  but they're small niggles really .  boogie nights is an excellent film .  superb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film .  whatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights .

"every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars "" sur-prise ! ""  into my bewildered visage .  it's almost always a surprise .  it sure as niflheim was this time .  amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason .  and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a "" boy , i wish that could happen "" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash .  another e . t .  another short circuit .  this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time .  america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) .  amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama .  this is a very sturdy scenario .  the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role .  the writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the "" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen "" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before !  astounding !  he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it !  i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film .  i don't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons .  his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , "" amazing "" grace smith , and , well , i'm leaving it at that because i wouldn't spoil this film for you for the world .  let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply .  i don't give a rat's ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it's an excellent story , told with excellence .  no , i don't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think .  the point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen .  this is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot .  it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness .  special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing's manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is  ",1
"the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane .  billy , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble .  christopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books .  he thinks he's a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports .  jack , played by peter boyle , thinks he's jesus .  and finally , there's stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases .  the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium .  during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan .  the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast .  the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another .  henry and jack , for example , fight over who's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game .  the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other .  michael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity .  as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh .  although stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing .  while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special .  lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance .  his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character .  lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character .  the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise .  the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot .

"ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers .  synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ?  in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem .  dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery .  poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner .  a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) .  is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ?  he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues .  but when the clues don't fit , it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city .  to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city .  how come it's always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ?  and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ?  every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the 'strangers' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads with big hypodermic needles .  the strangers have the ability to 'tune , ' or warp reality using telepathic powers .  turns out , the city is not on earth at all .  and the reason why john doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers .  even with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ?  opinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always "" used to have big spaceships blow up cities .  i think we're a little tired of that . ""  according to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers .  it's designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch .  it's a philosophical piece .  cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) .  but science fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ?  what is the human condition ?  what is ethical ?  what would a true human being do ?  far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner .  dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay .  a little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes .  the people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available .  meanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven .  when science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments .  but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old .  this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it .  the existentialists' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe .  in dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , "" because the human condition isn't located in here .

"the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is .  i mean that as the highest compliment .  if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide .  the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence .  along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable .  the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby .  they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair .  complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete .  in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved .  john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong .  claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her .  andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence .  cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train .  it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed .  a pall is cast on the whole affair .  a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments .  in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love .  we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship .  during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could .  all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates .  the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people .  so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky .  or they're reduced to comedic buffoons .  ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is .  they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives .  bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified .  norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept .  we feel for him .  he's a decent man .  sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now .  with so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does .  however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .

"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films .  i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years .  i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film .  by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance .  all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience .  it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts .  it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in .  i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain .  anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond .  i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films .  there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined .  and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series .  the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series .  everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 .  for the most part , the action sequences worked very well .  although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film .  i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted .  while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film .  most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie .  he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing .  but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing .  if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit .  the world is not enough is no exception .  this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world .  007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain .  why this point is included is beyond me .  they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought .  anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline .  i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore .  bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims .  along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) .  like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words .  my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films .  there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing .  the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character .  it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film .  later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something .  but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly .  after all , it isn't shakespeare .  how about the cast ?  brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 .  i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character .  judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role .  she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner .  robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie .  coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes .  then there are the bond girls .  sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today .  there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim .  those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face .  marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest .  then we have denise richards .  there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks .  and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes .  i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist .  admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely .  i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character .  while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me .  the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground .  i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character .  this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations .  last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever .  although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch .  rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role .  he says future appearances are up to a higher power .  the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese .  while we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands .  so how does it stack up ?  despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie .  and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies .  this is easily the best of the brosnan films .  it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 .  one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series .  here's looking forward to bond number 20 .

"a cinematic version of one of john irving's novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of "" simon birch , "" the treatment is merely "" suggested by , "" rather than strictly based on , the book .  suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed "" the world according to garp , "" sold the rights to his novel "" a prayer for owen meany "" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names .  that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product .  irving's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters .   "" a prayer for owen meany "" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , "" like strangled mice . ""  simon believes himself to be "" god's instrument , "" placed on this earth to somehow effect god's plan .  simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally .  smith's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for "" simon birch "" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith's acting abilities are limited at best .  another drawback is that in the book , simon's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail .  watching "" simon birch , "" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended .  simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film's director and screenwriter .  fortunately , simon birch isn't the real star of the film that bears his name .  simon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny .  first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( "" jurassic park "" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon's best friend , joe .  mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent .  ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben .  david strathairn and jan hooks play the town's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others .  there's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . .  well , that would be telling .  perhaps "" suggested by "" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since "" simon birch "" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon's extraordinary life .  the film also changes the book's ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon's lot .  the flavor of irving's original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there .

"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .  based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .  the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .  elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .  however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .  the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .  the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .  the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .  from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .  right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .  this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .  i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .  the film only gets better from this point .  with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .  they walk in unison and they only look forward .  as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .  holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .  one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .  wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless .   "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .  the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .  each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .  elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .  he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .  however , as the film develops so does ness .  his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .  he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .  his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .  sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .  malone acts as a mentor to ness .  he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .  connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .  andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .  as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .  charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .  smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .  the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .  also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense .  >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .  the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .  its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .  the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .  although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .  some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .

"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage .   ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . )  in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china .  a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle .  mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father .  ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph .  the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes .  mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman .  the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) .  in disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army .  old mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) .  fearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead .  meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner .   ( his only duty is to ring a gong . )  mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero .  with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ?  opinion : east meets west .  i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors .  from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan .  i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ?  yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic .  the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever .  personally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative .  mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney .  kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing .  and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles .  and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning .  but even the tiniest details reveal quality .  the movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place .  computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback .  and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game .  balance is crucial .  a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow !  the dream team .  by the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp .  it's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye .  it's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color .

"gordon fleming ( peter mullan ) is in a bind .  he has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under .  when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one .  it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in "" session 9 . ""  gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there .  their guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum .  but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store .  as they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen .  gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him .  phil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend .  mike ( co-screenwriter steven gevedon ) has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions ( hence , the title ) with inmate mary hobbs , a multi-personality patient with a dark secret .  gordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital .  as the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital .  tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away .  but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all .  i don't want to give away too much of the story of "" session 9 , "" so i'll stop there .  what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of "" halloween "" and "" friday the thirteenth . ""  there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror .  with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is "" frightening . ""  as i watched "" session 9 "" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie .  the striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his "" next stop wonderland "" ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud .  music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying .  couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of "" the shining , "" "" the blair witch project "" and , even "" the texas chainsaw massacre "" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick .  additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation .  acting is another factor that raises "" session 9 "" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like "" scream , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" and their sequels .  those films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror .  anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable .  mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital .  the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem .  david caruso , as gordo's senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is .  he made the jump from tv's "" nypd blue "" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i'll never forget the horrendous "" jade "" ) were less than star making .  he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here .  gevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too .  the only problem with "" session 9 "" lay in the uninspired ending .  it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up .  the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film   "" session 9 "" is an unusual feat .  it is scary , doesn't use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror .  because of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd .  i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves .  i give it a b+ .

"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws .  for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety .  that is no easy task .  superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express . ""  as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons .  the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film .  for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise . ""  in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim . ""  problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system .  the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) .  they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents .  once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside .  they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam .  he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene .  by now alarm bells are going off among viewers .  the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice .  long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin .  just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch .  left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice .  for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel .  as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife .  a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises .  much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion .  lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments .  is he part of a wider conspiracy ?  with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them .  the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape .  if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue .  and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie .  but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded .  for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations .  ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing .  young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure .  presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) .  clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend .  she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) .  whereas darlene's life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning .  one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo .  tellingly , alice is present but not included .  just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade .   "" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank .  however unintentional , it's all alice's fault .  she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick .   ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . )  dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence .  never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate .  dar is innocent .  it doesn't matter .  alice is the subject of this movie .  she and her journey toward personal freedom .  along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals .  in the end , that culture , like its representatives , "" yankee "" hank and dar's father ( a "" man who knows how to grease the wheels "" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy .  thailand's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison .  it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .  i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .  the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .  the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born .  their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit .  the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and "" hard manual labor "" consisted of picking grass !  the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic .  as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality .  'freedom' has many faces and "" brokedown palace "" explores many of them .  in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit .  some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .  but freedom seldom comes without a price .  which is why the movie's other tag lines are : "" what is your dream ? ""  and "" how far would you go ? ""  i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film's end is alice .  she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility .  i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .  kate beckinsale's character might more properly be likened to the "" released "" temple bird referred to twice during the film , "" trained to fly back to its cage . ""  as the thai magistrate observed in the film's climactic scene , the issue was always one of "" character ; "" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that "" freedom "" is achieved within oneself .  if one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ?  increasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of 'kung fu woman'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures .  here , at last , is the story of a modern heroine .  in reading the many user's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors .  think about that .  when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ?  do yourself a favor : rent "" brokedown palace "" and watch it with a open mind .  there's more there than meets the eye .

"ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances .  for his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) .  despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences .  the film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england .  as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback .  meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest .  lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology .  lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor .  lucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself .  yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin .  and fate has decreed that they will one day meet .  that day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help .  another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory .  at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other .  a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent .  but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her .  oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions .  on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route .  coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere .  the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments .   ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . )  yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda .  storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters .  thematically , the film is also strong .  the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated .  oscar and lucinda don't just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls .  a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional "" strip poker "" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion .  oscar does not see gambling as a vice .  in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one's immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith .  ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar .  the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen .  as good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett .  the actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford's paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda .  she gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles .  effective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen's persuasion ) as lucinda's close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar's mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer .  there's a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence .   ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . )  with the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package .  the characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett .  so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ?  oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer .

"full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america .  this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war .  however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp .  these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning .  as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start .  the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved .  from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey .  apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations .  private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt .  hartman .  the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on .  the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt .  hartman , continues on .  private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor .  he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop .  that is , until sgt .  hartman comes up with a new plan .  he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can .  pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst .  pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine .  after graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service .  he is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat .  when he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start .  joker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way .  he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die .  again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not .  a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide .  full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past .  this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others .  that , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion .  one thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to .  unfortunately , many did .

"when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image .  when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships .  when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point .  cool .  _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky .  was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ?  have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ?  it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal .  determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them .  it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket .  when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win .  but the joy in a film like this is in the little details .  for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class .  if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer .  it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does .  it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again .  homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ .  here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions .  this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is .  he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams .  but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how .  through coal-mining .  because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come .  the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us .  we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family .  the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life .  so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought .  and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you .  btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background .  another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .

"in zoolander , the world's most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , "" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? ""  obviously , the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ?  no , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more .  much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie .  it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) .  but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused .  better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag .  zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs .  fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed .  enter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight .  on the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme .  much like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today .  wilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel .  ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers .  jerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein .  even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse .  as for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners .  unfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here .  maybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years .  she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role .  while zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days .  zoolander's no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction .

"the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season .  bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep .  for those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive .  after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled .  immediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow .  that he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean's prison camp , on his trail .  thematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette .  years after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert .  valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own .  the "" father "" and "" daughter "" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) .  the decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year's stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla's sense of snow .  he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace .  production designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast .  neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role .  the younger members of the cast fare less well .  danes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard .  as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved .  while i was touched by valjean's relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved .  not even reaching the "" touching "" level is the cosette-marius pairing .  my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) .  her presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough .  even so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex .

"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .  webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . ""  they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics .  like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) .   "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" ) .  webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it .  here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad .  it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung .  the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one .  after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this .  they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side .  this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down .  okay , it is a let-down .  i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good .  but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand .  in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless .  then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva .  the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light .  for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off .  however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful .  from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical .  no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .  we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .  more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work .  juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .  a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before .  >from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden .  but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star .  that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame .  describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .  alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done "" fame , "" "" the committments , "" "" bugsy malone , "" and "" pink floyd the wall "" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is .  we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented .  his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .  and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings "" don't cry for me , argentina , "" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .  madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film .  at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .  her death , though , is brilliant .  her singing could be better though .  i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard .  she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti  lupone - i heard her sing on an old "" evita "" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .  but it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .  antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator .  his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin .  he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range .  and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .  although it gets off to a rocky start ( "" rocky "" 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .  like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's "" everyone says i love you "" ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .

"probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism .  everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time .  and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere .  i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes .  while their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- "" . . and  they lived happily ever after . . "" .  and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air .  however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues .  in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking .  somewhere inside the ship , lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead .  here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912 .  lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model .  she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years .  as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) .  on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e . j .  smith ( bernard hill ) .  on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive .  a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death .  cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself .  the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera .  the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script .  because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking .  russel carpenter's rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy .  everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch .  but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them .  the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake .  jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny . . . you  name it .  he doesn't have any dark side , he doesn't make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human .  jack is perfect , but he is - poor .  on the other hand we have cal .  he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be .  he lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich .  this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture .  cameron knows precisely what we want to see .  his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a "" tragic love story "" , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the "" greatest film of all time "" .  on the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about .  the main weakness of this film , which ironically became its success , is simplicity .  cameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love , hate , fear and helplessness .  everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship .  titanic is a typical hollywood production , totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot .  it's a good picture , but absolutely not a masterpiece .  it's among hundreds and thousands good films released every year , not better or worse than the average american film .

"the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance .  plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom .  unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! )  caught in his zipper , and misses the big night .  thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her .  once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins .  critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep .  having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics .  this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others .  then again , maybe my expectations were too high .  then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film .  continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together .  this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged .  i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not .  not a good place to be .  having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline .  the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) .  on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture .  i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting .  also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer .  and of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still can't seem to find the "" right guy "" ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) .  i did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) .  i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux-sympathy british accent .  funny stuff .  also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip-synched version of "" build me up buttercup "" , which is really cool .  overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes .  little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script "" dust to dust "" into the hands of eddie murphy via ? murphy's neighbour .  they only found out about murphy's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night .  matt dillon is a high school dropout .  in between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business .  close to home in his native new york , he co-owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls .  cameron diaz stands 5 "" 9 , started working as a model at the early age of 16 , and loves cats .  ben stiller's father is jerry stiller .  he played george costanza's ( jason alexander ) father on tv's "" seinfeld "" .  peter farrelly has written a novel entitled "" outside providence "" which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin .  rob moran , who plays the cop in this film , also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin , and the bartender in dumb and dumber .  he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college , and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor/correspondant julie moran .  harland williams , who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film , also played a state trooper in the farrelly's earlier dumb and dumber , and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man .

( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio )   "" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise .  unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited .  unlike fires , there is no way to combat them .  unlike floods , their terror is sudden . ""  - excerpt from twister production notes  i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before .  i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister .  the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable .  it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . .  basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up !  twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers .  these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that  is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !  jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes .  while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo .  apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman .  he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone .  jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented .  the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function .  to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device .  thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans .  plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about .  twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get .  there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) .  helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself !  thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock !  jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences .  like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited .  audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen !  the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister !   ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie .  now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et's ass for the umpteenth time . . . . . . twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent !  watch it in a good theatre . . . please .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

"ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars  synopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church .  he replies something like : "" the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire .  well , the fire wasn't that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows . ""  in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding .  everyone has had to evacuate because it's raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break .  enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) .  suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters .  tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life .  this makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call .  he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) .  but unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom's initial distress call .  will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ?  opinion : don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics .  there's not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that's what makes it escapist and fun .  relax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn .

"having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently .  watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .  aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery .  while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun .  the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .  cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k .  maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work .  maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots .  valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .  upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .  the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name .  along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . '  `who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .  director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators .  also bob hoskins' performance should be credited .  he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .  according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off .  `who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film .  one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) .  do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please .

"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to .  it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy .  yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story .  the wings of the dove fits the pattern .  kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love .  merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate .  but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class .  her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man .  naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich . ""  kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable .  kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice .  at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees .  kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her .  it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup .  merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it .  he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute .  the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated .  let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton .  merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate .  kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple .  a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact .  at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies .  millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate .  she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees .  kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together .  merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her .  he's not sure he can separate the two .  kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else .  the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved .  without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly .  the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament .  one is left with feelings of regret and despair .  what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy .  an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir .  a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after .  their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake .  i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting .  as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot .  roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie .  millie's part didn't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible .  i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion .  their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially .  still , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over .

"mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . '  austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery .  many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film .  austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles .  he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr . evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth .  tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr . evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space .  dr . evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents .  upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr . evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr . evil , which is later named mini me .  the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr . evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr . evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil . ""  dr . evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one .  dr . evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner .  dr . evil loving ?  wow !  mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body .  austin powers learns of dr . evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it .  once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil .  as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , "" don't go there , girlfriend ! ""  to the president of the united states .  many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes .  take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is .  the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing .  there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing .  the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers !  it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it .  the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . ""  tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england .  i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters .  i believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did .  dr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film .  i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard .  also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer .  even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil's side constantly .  the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor .  mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles .   ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them .  heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion .  speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments .  hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures .  the bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing .

"good films are hard to find these days .  great films are beyond rare .  proof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems .  a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true .  consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world .  i haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway .  but enough with the gossip , let's get to the review .  the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers .  upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million .  the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money .  with no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband .  but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands .  the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors .  the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne .  the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso .  dug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor .  ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne .  the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes .  the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters .  the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise .  director taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film .  proof of life is a thinking man's action movie .  it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night .

"plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side .  but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster .  violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue .  critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending .  here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix .  okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here .  the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place .  it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good !  yes , it's all about the suits , fellas . . . the  italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you .  here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place .  but that's not the basis of this movie .  the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other .  you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ?  well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that  is , their boss .  so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence .  but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package .  of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix .  nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this .  the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty !   ( "" look into my eyes ! "" )  in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing .  scary shite .  but there's an ever better scene than that in this film .  this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear ) .  that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) .  but the flick's not perfect .  in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot .  all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( "" . . . so  i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . "" -it's  like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! !  overdone . ) .  i also didn't quite "" buy "" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ?  i mean , c'mon . . . it's 30 years , man ! !  i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me .  but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot .  forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis .  incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal !  note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time .  it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . .   ; )  where's joblo coming from ?  american psycho ( 10/10 ) - a clockwork orange ( 9/10 ) - donnie brasco ( 8/10 ) - fight club ( 10/10 ) - get carter ( 7/10 ) - godfather ( 10/10 ) - godfather ii ( 10/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) - lock , stock & two smoking barrels ( 8/10 ) - pulp fiction ( 8/10 ) - reservoir dogs ( 9/10 )  ",1
"as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences .  you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a "" to kill "" list for his enemies .  oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century .  as gibson delivers lines like , "" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , "" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind .  oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure .  at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun .  i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend .  some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it .  like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all .  sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism .  and isn't that the point of the patriot ?  gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away .  he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) .  as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields .  but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) .  forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army .  the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right .  every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment .  and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable .  as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done .  clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating .  you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period .  everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge .  it's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective .  there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin's take-no-prisoners method .  what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington .  played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact .  this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil .  his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as "" cowardly "" and "" sadistic . ""  i disagree with this accusation .  tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general .  besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized .  and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ?  heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ?  the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks .  with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it's a lethal weapon for the colonial times .  god bless america !  and god bless the patriot !

"luckily , some people got starship troopers .  some people knew it was supposed to be silly .  for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ?  from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly .  i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor .  such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned .  first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up .  meet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers "" .  four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country .  johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot .  dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for .  if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of "" seventeen "" magazine .  the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture .   ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) .  right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time .  but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits .  with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home .  well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it .  that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy .  with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs .  what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously .  it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it's not as recognizably so .  it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery .  if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong .  it's sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well .  gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy .  yes , it's graphic , but it's also brutally phony , and that's what makes it such great fun to watch .  not since the old "" mr . bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch .  people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated .  perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children .  with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it's a good chance this is the case , whether we're fully aware of it or not .  starship troopers has it's slow parts , but it's truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy .  aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding .  when the spaceship passes a meteor , it's quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating .  if you're looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search .  a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore .  this is brainless heaven .  just remember not to think .

"sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston ) .  he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him .  but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back .  he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them .  suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back .  on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him .  she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either .  after all , people die every day .  in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on .  the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times .  but we haven't .  griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since "" while you where sleeping "" .  the camera obscura adds a "" special something "" to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy .  everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting .  the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite .  meg ryan , known from "" when harry met sally "" or "" sleepless in seattle "" , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image .  she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl .  even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years "" courage under fire "" where she played a gulf war pilot .  matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality .  the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them .  he has trouble keeping in touch with reality .  after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ?  his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge .  she would do anything to harm anton .  she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them .  that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier .  tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton .  he is , well , repulsive .  that's all there is to say about him .  you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps .  he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef .  worlds collide , i .  e .  the usa and france .  this can only go wrong .  even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can't sympathize with a man who plays "" je t'aime . . . moi  non plus "" on his tape deck .  not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for .  sam certainly isn't .  too bad for anton .  for him things take a turn to the worse .

"only a year after the initial release of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters .  while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story .  the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant .  the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening .  i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy .  its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else .  the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general .  although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well .  everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time .  more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film .  the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show .  understandably , "" scream 2 "" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted .  couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right .  we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner .  while i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing .  unfortunately , "" scream 2 "" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window .  for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion .  there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction .  as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor .   .   .  well , it's hard to say .  i gave the first "" scream "" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up .   "" scream 2 "" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment .  i'm not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck .

"it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film .  films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio .  the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films .  the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut .  for years , i have heard of an "" international "" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years .  i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on .  but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it .  until now .  the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello .  he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops .  one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries .  taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life .  mathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a "" cleaner . ""  she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession .  at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in .  the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed "" too explicit . ""  i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle .  the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops .  there's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe .  with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version .  the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film .  the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema .  my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece .  director/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello  ",1
"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture]  war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media .  movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory .  it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other .  forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number .   "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery .  it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing .  the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory .  it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them .  spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality .  instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared .  there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops .   "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are .  there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters .  we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding .  the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there .  in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen .  the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies .  they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off .  perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme .  the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil . ""  the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage .  i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief .  to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened .  one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting .  the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet .  tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon .  he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this .  he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out .  the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan .  through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously .  when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother .  it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once .  but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . ""  the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one .  his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had .  when miller's company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off .  he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality .  the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination , but not direction .  along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad .  a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice .  the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors .  the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses .  unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible .  in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work .  although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time .  whether they're arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable .  sure , there's a zinger here and there , but war doesn't change the fact boys will be boys .  if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them .  the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence .  private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ?  that's not a premise for thrills , it's symbolic of everything the film has worked for .  it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end .  i remember reading a "" calvin & hobbes "" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , "" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? ""   "" saving private ryan "" is the adult version of that question .  ",1
"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .  for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .  to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .  the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .  in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .  getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?  the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .  it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .  when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .  abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .  upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach .  i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .  in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .  it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .  and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .  don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .  now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .  the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .  oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .  even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .  ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .  i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad .  the film , however , is all good .  2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content  ",1
"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream .  although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre .  the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes .  the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost .  scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight .  and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion .  it's hard to understate this last point .  mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) .  indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented .   ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained . )  and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters .  in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels .  scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel .  while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging .  like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) .  however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) .  there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical .  flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film .  the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney .  they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded .  the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ?  there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) .  any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim .  as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit .  one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer .  here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery .  the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements .   ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . )  indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes .  this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it .  while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences .  they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch .  it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown .  in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) .  their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed .  on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here .  she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine .  given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film .  what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast .  the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel .   ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . )  but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : "" no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! ""  look what that got her .  ",1
"not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility .  while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement .  jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia .  on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer .  here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia .  strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity .  later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life .  one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good .  it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison .  he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" don't talk about fight club . ""  armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees .  resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla .  funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem .  their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour .  it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist .  it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting .  it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out .  fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people .  in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it .  i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone .  they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke .  tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization .  in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't .  hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us .

"ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company ,  synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time .  rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant .  rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) .  jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice .  will rudy defeat leo ?  will he enjoy being a lawyer ?  opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing .  director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie .  in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) .  however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key .  'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters .  in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general .  two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be .  first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case .  also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge .  the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age .

" "" being john malkovich "" is the type of film we need to see more .  today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes .  malkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur .  this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable .  john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time .  his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment .  when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk .  when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor .  it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time .  meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her .  the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever .  the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream .  being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies .  i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery .  in my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant .  it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you .  it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue .  even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing .  it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion .  it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed .  other than that , i had a very enjoyable time .  the acting was quite delightful as well .  john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well .  he's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i'm hoping that will change .  cameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off .  john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice .  who else's mind would be better to explore ?  the director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings really catches my attention with this project .  i knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme .  he too is likely too receive media attention .   "" being john malkovich "" isn't an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite .  what's even better is the film's puzzling message . . . am  i nick lyons ?

"when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space .  it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver .  but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet .  austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks .  if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ?  -- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex .  even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery .  the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody .  all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america .  ironically , powers' "" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! ""  has almost become an icon of the late 90s .  thus another installment was inevitable , but it's also undoubtedly welcome .  the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life .  it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones .  austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you'll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen .  he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again .  surprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin .  he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie .  perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately .  instead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe .  the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting more .  by the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites .  even by its conclusions , i'm still not sure i've had my fill of bits like "" do you smoke after sex ? ""   "" i don't know , baby , i never looked . ""  this may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny .  i don't know if i've ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious "" just the two of us "" rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named "" mini-me "" .  i don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort .  indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did .  but as far as i'm concerned , that is enough .   ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ;  ",1
"richard gere is not one of my favorite actors .  however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on .  i wasn't disappointed .  it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns .  one thing : what's with the title ?  not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine .  in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it .  martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney .  he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers .  once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get .  we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) .  vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) .  there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces .  we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail .  richard gere does a fairly good job .  at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth .  but we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client .  alfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role .  laura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable .  her relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film .  the actor who playes vail's investigator ( unfortunately , i don't remember his name ) is quite good .  his female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can't remember where i've seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular .  the best performance in the film was by edward norton .  he was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged "" butcher boy of st . mike's "" .  i was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending .  i liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating .

"the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam .   ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . )  while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt .  maj . archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune .  these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles .  our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs .  they are gates , new father sgt .  troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt .  chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt .  conrad vig ( music video director jonze ) .  at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends .  barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an "" ass-map "" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion .  gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt .  ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy .  so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence .  when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help .   ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . )  gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck .  the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges .  but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces .  the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime .  barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device .  his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child .   ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . )  i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal .  it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib .  russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother .   ( it's great . )  his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish .  one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence .  when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast .  three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture .  stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas .  newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate .  one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen .   ( a friend enthusiastically added , "" it's like having sand in your eyes . "" )  this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade .   ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . )  russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant .   ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . )  if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us .  its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell .  subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status .   ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . )  clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , "" let my people go ! ""  hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture .   ( it's not spoiling much to write that . )  then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ?   ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters . )  russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared .  if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded .  with flair .

"of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many "" laugh-out-loud "" moments .  i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes .  and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny .  usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign .  waiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event .  the play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this "" mockumentary "" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success .  teaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others .  everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out .  these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are .  although levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances !  if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it .  some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros .  as delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous .  thankfully , just as your about to say "" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom "" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes .  like a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) .  like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach .  you can't really watch these people and not think they're real people !  even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary .  and even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful !  as a word of note , despite it's "" r "" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean .  this rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words .  even if that really bothers you , let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way .  it's actually quite humorous and tastefully done !  it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman .  it's silly humor , but it's also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you're not insulted by it .  it's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones !  i'd recommend seeing it !

"" serial killer chic "" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones .  i've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry .  i wasn't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero .  thankfully , that's not the way henry works .  the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work .  it doesn't provide cheap-jack explanations for henry's behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him .  at the film's opening , henry's friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago .  in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers .  they are damned together from that moment on .  henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun .  the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv .  the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron .  no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker .  in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment .  the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation .  henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting .  michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well .  the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn't see release .  the film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was .  i'm hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of "" victim "" or "" hero "" .  then again , probably , so would henry .

"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being .  even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience .  on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view .  this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life .  the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense .  instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters .  although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime .  amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much .  every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible .  distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect .  in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it .  after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film .  fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film .  even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images .  characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions .  every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions .  because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life .  even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy .  when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour .  unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics .  lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters .  each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears .  fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people .  because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments .  fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie .  vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies .  fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside .  even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall .  on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene .  this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota .  his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced .  that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .

" "" . . it's certainly more than just a monster story . . ""  - kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein .  kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale .  the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful .  but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story .  horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror .  branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches .  his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel .  the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean .  the year is 1794 .  a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters .  his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs .  as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon .  it's a man .  exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew .  his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown .  the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 .  he is remembering his childhood and youth .  laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns .  here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony .  this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed .  like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother .  shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death .  standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother . . you  did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i  will stop this . . i  promiss . . ""  after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career .  after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death .  composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally .  with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation .  the result was ugliness .  realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late .  the creature has escaped .  because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding .  for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death .  but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . .  whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel .  brannagh has more or less done that .  another thing is characters and actors .  branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast .  the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro .  alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness .  at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love .  later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge .  he is capable of killing without regret .   "" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and  then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and  as i killed him , i saw your face . . ""  that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator .  and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : "" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . ""  rarely has a cinematic interpretation of "" the daemon "" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel .  another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein .  in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm .  almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel .  here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene .  branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character .  on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past .  helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart .  the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing .  visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) .  the spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold .  kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : "" . . all  i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by  my hand . . "" .  and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire .  the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness .  and a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face .  can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ?  to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ?  shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them .  following her example , branagh does the same .  his film is a tragic saga about playing god .  victor frankenstein is not an evil man .  he wanted to change the world to the better .  in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions .  produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film "" dracula "" .  in comparison , i can say that "" dracula "" has visuals that even "" frankenstein "" can not live up to .  but when it comes to story , characters and casting , "" frankenstein "" is stronger .  but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's "" interview with the vampire "" .  although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating .  branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel .

"the "" submarine "" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is .  think about it . . .  these films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public .  they aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those .  and they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet .  when a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say "" ugh , another submarine movie "" like people tend to say "" ugh , another boxing movie "" .  look at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . .  all are well regarded as top-notch entertainment .  gladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii .  we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) .  mcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence .  the mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters .  the first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence .  the german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion .  it's tense , exciting and fascinating .  and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles .  most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away .  once the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder "" ok , now how do they get out of this ? "" .  the stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it's a lot of fun getting there .  i only have two minor complaints about the entire film .  the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence .  while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally .  i mean , did we really have to see the ship's crew at a wedding ?  because of that , you now know exactly what's going to happen to the groom !  my other gripe would be during the film's finale .  there's an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one .  i cannot stress this enough . . .  until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models .  yes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you "" that couldn't happen "" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment .  it succeeds fantastically .

">from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight .  instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .  the concept is deceptively pedestrian .  an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .  the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .  the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .  following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin .  it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .  seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .  without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion .  and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner .  a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs .  drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations .

"it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a . i .  artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material .  for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg's body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e . t .  to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples .  a . i . is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies .  it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances .  the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children .  and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution .  a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love .  as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o'connor ) .  their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness .  the first third of a . i .  deals with david's life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin .  circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons .  he is abandoned and alone .  david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him .  the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish .  during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex .  spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal "" flesh fair "" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers .  here , is where kubrick's influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots .  the savagery conjures up images from the late director's a clockwork orange .  at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters .  it is all very anti-climatic and jarring .  these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film .  a . i . is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg-13 rating .  it is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images .  but a . i .  is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment .  if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving .  he shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please .  after being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother's eyes .  law is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesn't understand david's quest , but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey .  probably the toughest role is o'connor's monica .  playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin , she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance , but as a threat to her family .  she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action .  many of a . i . 's futuristic sets are breathtaking , especially a mostly submerged new york , lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps .  a . i . is a flawed film , and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering - even subconsciously - how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera .  would it have been darker ?  more cynical ?  we will never know .  we can only judge what is before us on the screen , a collaboration of two cinematic giants .  a . i .  is a most interesting and thought-provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us .

"robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often .  it is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years .  until 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time .  the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching .  a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because "" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off .

"contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact .  four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film .  the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy .  contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space .  her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) .  while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive .  ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young .  in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth "" .  despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together .  it's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on .  meanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding .  this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember .  it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science .  when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at .  eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) .  the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) .  as if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer .  contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion .  the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias .  arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking .  when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests .  the question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ?  even when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where "" right and wrong "" is only opinion ( at least speaking "" politically correctly "" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive .  don't get me wrong .  as much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film .  it's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours .  despite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film .  the special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! )  highly depreciated on the small screen .  even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as "" sci-fi "" .  the storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen .  this is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast .

"david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director .  with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible .  some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline .  and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right .  oh , and it's rated g .  incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century .  he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note .   "" did you do it ? "" he asks his boy .   "" no father , i didn't , "" ronnie answers .  that's enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court .  they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task .  it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century .  but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that .  soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings .  so do we .  all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent .  the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense .  but this is not mamet's norm , and it's refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were .  nigel hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless .  his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game .  we pity the man , but we also like him .  rebecca pidgeon , david mamet's wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur's oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women's suffrage movement .  the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one .  be honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ?  if you wanted to but didn't , this is a movie for you .  it is the epitome of subtlety : it's powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing .  david mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too .  he is almost a national treasure .  his films deserve their own genre .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  ",1
"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro .  if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house .  that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie .  it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either .  in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie .  but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ?  that is endlessly refreshing .  in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track .  the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story .  what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important .  david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm .  he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact .  but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character .  he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family .  robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing .  he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding .  the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) .  robbie takes it hard .  he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings "" love stinks "" at a wedding .  julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to .  eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia .  he really likes her , but she's engaged .  her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand .  julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her .  you know the story .  you've seen it a million times before .  there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story .  and sometimes , it works .  the wedding singer works .  first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective .  actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension .  sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love .  barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with .  sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other .  second , their love is mature .  they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material .  instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with .  at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by .  the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child .  the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie .  other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack .  i liked it in spite of the soundtrack .  often , the music and references felt forced .  for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to "" get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . ""   ( ha ha ha .  get it ?  david lee roth did leave van halen ! )  or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove .   ( that's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) .  unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding .  that's not to say the movie isn't funny .  screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination .  herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style .  let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over .  with barrymore's charm and sandler's heart , it was hard to go wrong .

"the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up .  the film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood .  hrundi v . bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india .  hrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job .  on the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse .  during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can .  this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set .  many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever .  and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j .  edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi .  clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood .  but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur .  of course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble .  each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous .  and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way .  the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations .  it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say "" birdy num-num "" ? ) .  if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party .  it's not going to be one of your all-time favorites , but if you enjoy this type of humor , you'll enjoy the party .

"mary norton's children's book series , the borrowers , has been made into several below-average television movies .  so , i wasn't too enthused as i entered the theater for the big-screen debut of the minute clan .  but i was in for a shock , the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects .  the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home .  their aunt , who owned the property , never left a will .  now , an unscrupulous lawyer , ocious potter ( john goodman ) plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra-modern housing development .  but the lenders are not alone in their house .  living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers , 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human "" beans "" above .  the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders , especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders .  so it is up to the clocks ( pod ( jim broadbent ) and homily ( celia imrie ) , along with their kids , arrietty ( flora newbigin ) and peagreen ( tom felton ) ) to recover the will and save the household .  but when potter learns of the tiny people , he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff ( mark williams ) to kill off the clan .  there's plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers , especially in the furnishings of the clock family house , made out of lost board game parts and credit cards .  the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story .  the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling .  based on an original story , the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4-inch tall person .  as the villain , john goodman's performance veers on the edge of being over-the-top .  but his performance suits the role well , and he does very well in the film's many slapstick moments .  with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets , bluescreen shots and cgi , the special effects in the borrowers are very well done .  there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work , but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief .  hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children-only movie , for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch .

"most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy .  rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique .  the rocky formula of "" rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight "" is carried out to the letter .  also the 'tradition' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well .  this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . .  even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! !  then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) .  a mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he "" pities the fool "" for not coming out and fighting him outright .  rocky's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn't listen .  naturally , he gets his ass kicked .  somewhere along the line after this several things happen .  rocky's longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed .  rocky's wife complains to her husband that he should fight .  the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky .  guess who wins ?  the winner's name rhymes with 'smocky' .  the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang's over the top performance .  the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film .  which is good if you like fighting scenes .  the last match is quite decent actually .  if you liked the previous films , rent this one .  it's well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series .  but if you can't stand rocky shouting "" adrianne ! ! !

"for many people , procrastination isn't a problem to overcome , it's a high art .  we'll do just about anything to put off a task .  when the deadline for this column nears , it's the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and . . .  eventually , hopefully , sometimes , there's a breakthrough and we actually get down to work .  amazingly it's almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing , that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away .  and then , the next time , we do it all again .  english professor grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a master .  seven years ago , his first book was a hit .  he's been working on his second -- a short 200-page piece -- since then .  fearful that he can't live up to the first , he can't bring himself to finish it .  no writer's block , he's nearing 3 , 000 pages with no end in sight .  now he's having a particularly difficult day .  the college's annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing _their_ books .  during the first day , his wife has left him , his married girlfriend informs him she's pregnant and his agent is in town with a six-foot transvestite in tow .  by the evening , our besieged writer is driving though the snow-covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him , a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk .  this could be a pivotal point in his mid-life crisis .  and then there's the next morning .  there's a lot to like about this movie .  there are no huge explosions , shattering glass or computer-generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues .  grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career .  in the world of "" what have you done for me lately ? "" , he knows his second book has to be better than his first .  instead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood .  he doesn't have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire ) .  james may be suicidal and psychotic .  certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie .  he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn't interesting enough .  as the weekend progresses , they are both forced to fully engage life .  that's the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ?  the film takes some interesting chances .  non-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact .  extra-marital , gay , interracial , professor-student : here they aren't judged , merely choices .  the actors are all first-rate .  douglas triumphs , playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled , unshaven and clad in a pink women's house robe .  maguire's disengaged alienation works perfectly here .  robert downey jr . as grady's agent livens up his scenes .  director curtis hanson ( "" l . a .  confidential "" ) makes a few missteps .  the women are underused .  frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady's married lover but we never understand much of who she is .  the chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing .  katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere .  we never even see grady's exiting wife .  this is very much a guy's film .  the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others .  grady's alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara .  as the boomers age , expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic .  eventually it'll probably become cliche , but right now we've got a winner .  i'll finish this in a second .  right now i have to grab some paint .  i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch-up .

"look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future .  some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence .  >from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different .  perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact .  maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ?  film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject .  the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance .  these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red .  however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life .  in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . ""  while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths .  the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either .  writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train .  the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family .  as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals .  that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit .  one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day .  the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform .  in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station .  on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty .  minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .  in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging .  she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity .  juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there .  on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience .  but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill .  one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less .  it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid .  paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout .  she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man .  john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable .  john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer .  only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place .  her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element .  one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice .  douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in .  part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie .  on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy .  on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . ""  but it's not all in the dialogue .  mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy .  this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb .  the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole .  sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however .  for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .

" "" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .  and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .  the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .  he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .  as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .  there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .  so why did i enjoy it so much ?  for one thing , the cast is great .  kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .  we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort .  yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .  and he never broods .  the rest of the cast is equally impressive .  john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .  but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .  by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .  another nice touch is the music .  we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that's not true at all .  the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .  during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .  of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .  anyway , "" footloose "" is a charming little surprise .  don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .  it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .

"it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable .  somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through .  set in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) .  an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help .  figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics .  soon homer is delivering babies like a professional .  he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly .  larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer "" continues to have such high expectations of people . ""  such is the result of an insulated upbringing .  though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else .  he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it .  befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived .  thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor .  tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . .  many of which he was unaware needed to be asked .  he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing .  michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world .  calling them "" princes of maine , kings of new england "" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine .  delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins .  director lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter .  regardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers .  the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers .  figuring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along .  dr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly .  there is a danger in that line of reasoning .  god has also given us a set of rules .  unlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination .  and yet , many continue to ignore his "" rules "" preferring to make up their own as they go through life .   "" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .

"it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens .  however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill .  in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture .  the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps .  peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation .  every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in  other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life .  he's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities .  he's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself .  everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck .  but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions .  he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing .  he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like .  peter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no ,  not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude .  but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . .  as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one .  although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life .  each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible .  yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal .  ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it .  his character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity .  he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life .  anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film .  in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic .  the animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity .  most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk .  one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon .  however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny .  it's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) .  the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .

"jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s .  enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960's series , star trek .  gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation .  as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again .  this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will .  it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists .  of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists .  insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films .  the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group .  in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction .  it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line .  many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat .  the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense .  there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ?  the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen .  so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible .  but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever .  the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon .  worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films .  no problem so far .  worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up .  in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie .  what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen .  my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones .  while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies .  the special effects are among the best for the star trek series .  the action is plentiful and well done .  this is a very good-looking movie .  it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate .  it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade .  they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster .  most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series .  if you've always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind .  star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .

" "" a bug's life "" may not be "" toy story , "" but it's more close than "" antz "" was .  i really liked "" antz , "" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that .  maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick .   "" a bug's life "" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like "" antz "" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever .   "" antz "" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and "" a bug's life "" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining .  it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in "" antz . ""  it's also light and clever .  the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of "" antz "" at least a worthy contender .  the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films .  the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from "" antz , "" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper .  and for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames .  not that the plot's really any better than the one in "" antz "" - it's basically yet another redux of "" the seven samurai , "" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else .  when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers .  he runs into a group of "" warrirors "" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses .  these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in "" toy story "" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish .  the writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats .  grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake .  a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death .  the bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says "" kid tore off wings . ""  and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour .  around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket .  meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something "" antz "" couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , "" a bug's life "" pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing "" antz "" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment .  still , it's no "" toy story . ""  that film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit .  it proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun .  yet "" a bug's life , "" as well as "" antz , "" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof .

"the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films .  well , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty .  the story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry .  the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , "" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? ""  the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are "" him "" and "" her "" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are "" us "" ( during the good times ) .  the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day .  ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore .  ben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage .  katie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned .  the story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks .  as the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage .  this method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart .  through the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters .  the screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom .  the script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must .  if it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture .  bruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script .  although i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season .  where to start about michelle pfeiffer ?  pfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism .  pfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film .  the story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked .  superb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall .  the film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like "" it's over , "" or "" i hate you , "" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an "" us . ""  the bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film .  one of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years .  ",1
"when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster .  now , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought "" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? "" .  as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy .  robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit .  don't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference .  based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith .  allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer .  she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system .  her passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her .  a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied "" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now "" .  allie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation .  her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti .  undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation .  the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave .  the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government .  the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission .  as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go .  she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation .  her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning .  at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor .  a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey .  from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen .  the meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless .  many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions .  zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film .  contact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within .  i consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year .

"so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies .  the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' .  now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill .  the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house .  if they survive the night they get the money .  if not well you get the jurisdiction .  having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake .  but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on .  geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people .  his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends .  steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list .  somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party .  eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways .  what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night .  if they can they get the money , if not well they don't .  the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum .  years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they .  everyone who was in there burned to death .  now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people .  what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night .  the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed .  one-by-one the people start to disappear .  conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all .  the people find rooms , which once held mental patients .  rooms which once had people dying .  rooms which may still contain these people .  now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results .  since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better .  i can say however i liked this movie .  geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role .  famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times .  ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs .  chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines .  peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims .  the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing .  the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary .  i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous .  one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore .  even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell .  the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with .  the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it .  i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise .  i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending .  instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting .  house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously .  though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws .  but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !

"copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives !  sid james plays henry , who no sooner has the film started , is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon .  as part of his alliance with france , he requests the hand-in-marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) .  she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage .  henry's court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king .  there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution .  the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time .  the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices !  owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn't .  this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does .  by then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor !  it looks like he has some explaining to do !  there are stand-out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal .  also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara's father .  the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good .  there is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader .  the film does have it's downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry-on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly .  there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along .  however , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone's while to sit down and watch it .

"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies .  from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy .  but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves .  shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time .  sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a .  pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience .  no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul .  the excitement starts before the music even begins .  a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so .  there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick .  and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! ""  you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street .  this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience .  it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain .  and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love .  even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats .  the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal .  all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time .  in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time .  for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating .  all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us .  the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in .  if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled .  it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore .  instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .

"while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens' "" blood simple . ""  both are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes .  the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands .  both films are also flawed , but for different reasons .   "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow .   "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending .  the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end .  as the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow .  they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch .  a man named hugo moves into the apartment's remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose .  juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) .  the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning .  all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next .  other than the obvious question of why they don't report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills .  i will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn't give away too much of the plot .  broadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo's underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process .  a police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective .  david , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects .  director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other .  while i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue .  this could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional "" caper "" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more .  granted , this isn't really a "" happy "" ending , but it's still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it .  i really shouldn't say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable .  yes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i'd been cheated .  still , "" shallow grave "" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars .  i guess i just can't help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away .

"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation .  even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation .  this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction .  to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn .  he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide .   ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . )  tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm .  nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own .  the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her .  jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas .  this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico .  however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs .  jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted .  of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell .  ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police .  sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell .  instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal .  since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars .  with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ?  by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film .  however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think .  jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max .  the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around .  instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies .  at least this film has a little imagination .  most of the performances in jackie brown are above par .  pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable .  samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control .  robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . .  never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course .  he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade .  in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town .  unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences .  in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much . ""  fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side .  as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy .  it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves .  don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however .  there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience .  we look at the screen and think , "" gee , that's clever , "" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on .  although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film .  there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head .  this is a tribute to both direction and acting .  however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something .  we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop .  overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well .  some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today .  in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these "" offensive "" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness .  go see the film and see what i mean .

"you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing .  the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care .  the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike .  the seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom .  desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) .  the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret .  only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time .  malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures .  he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process .  the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist .   ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . )  it's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks .  cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler .  perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old .  that's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar .  we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed .  both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest .  willis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night .  osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do .  the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading .  only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours .  the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait .  i'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .

"118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language )  mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be .  oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent .  one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series .  in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan .  set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus .  as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan .  as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century .  with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime .  this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime .  the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness .  sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life .  those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers .  the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay .  this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization .  however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . .  shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% .  this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 .  since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos .   ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . )  it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it .  as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you .  _patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama .  it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) .  there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ .  this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism .  patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day .  the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ?  are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ?  this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting .  as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so .  the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to .  the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline .  as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ .  i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all .  the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences .  the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good .  even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side .  giant robot footsteps are deep and booming .  the sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery .  as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they're among the most easily-readable subtitles i've ever seen for _anything_ .  large enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen .  although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie .  although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment .  my .

"steven spielberg's "" amistad , "" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who "" owned "" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story .  first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery .  second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) .  last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade .   "" amistad "" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements .  i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another "" anti-slavery "" movie .  having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it .  fortunately , i turned out to be wrong .  for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so "" amistad "" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning .  and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery .  one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their "" excess "" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year .  spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating .  the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time .  exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation .  the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court .  the biggest success of "" amistad "" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court .  through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ .  cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles .   "" what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? "" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court .  spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room .  still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem .  the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie .  this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once .   "" amistad "" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through .  perhaps the best way to describe it is this : "" amistad "" is three four star films edited into one .  almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts .  however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .

"it is simply amazing how "" the green mile "" developed in its three hour running time .  based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue .  however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction .  frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in "" the shawshank redemption "" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) .  through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law .  from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , "" the green mile "" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners .  the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them .  the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb .  the ensemble acting in the film is perfect .  hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles .  they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles .  they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience .  the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting .  some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan .  hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie .  every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying .  it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks .  rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection .  as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others .  this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable .  the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill .  duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men .  his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause .  his pain creates pain for the viewer .  however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film .  the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at "" the jerry springer show . ""  the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks .  not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief .  as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction .  his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing .  greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile .  however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting .  the speed in "" the green mile "" is perfect .  if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others .  the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character .   "" the green mile "" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene .  fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing .  if you survive the first third of "" the green mile "" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

""  king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar .  consider it a view to a kill made abstract .  a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants .  the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , "" i don't know , "" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air .  what we don't see might not be able to hurt us .  just close your eyes and think of england .  during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them .  adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history .  resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .  grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along .  a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) .  the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence .  during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake .  rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob .  in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death .  when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears .  grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob .  through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape .  grace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) .  she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence .  maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance .  the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values .  aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones .  the duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) .  the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification .  lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke .  that's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic .  rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future .  what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism .  the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris .  this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets .  it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone .  why ?  they aren't real .  the very foundation rohmer's characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory .  screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .

"titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't .  the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film .  we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic .  but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films )  the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic .  they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman .  the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her .  the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic .  in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america .  also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich .  she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them .  oh yeah , and the ship sinks .  and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius .  the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak .  the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film .  without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear .  firstly , there's cameron's direction .  there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic .  but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end .  there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron .  it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below .  thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes .  to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters .  dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old .  his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines .  winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth .  zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash .  the audience really does come to hate him .  he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well .  also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american .  finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects .  cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout .  the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well .  the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them .  you can tell that they have been animated on a computer .  of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed .  titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film .  titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story .  again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts .  titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius .  enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound .  a superb film , but sadly not perfect .  overall rating= (  ",1
"sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film .  sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride .  i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes .  surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say .  but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year .  time alone will make that call .  but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side .  we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win .  that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last .  the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot .  unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics .  carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town .  truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers .  there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good .  but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky .  this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program .  what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir .  the soundstage , we're told , is "" only the second man-made structure visible from space . ""  truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams .  weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky .  the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence .  his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him .  his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product .  he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town .  one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : "" people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . ""  nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives .  this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way .  by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over .  there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , "" i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . ""  but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof .  the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side .  the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ?  ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator .  what does god really think of us ?  does he resent our abandonment of paradise ?  who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ?  if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work .  as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play .  carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be .  he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us .

"a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings .  family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail .  still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love .  and after it , i still can't .  bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare .  only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion .  bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children .  dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) .  over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma .  the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality .  randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening .  his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible .  he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn .  paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy "" mad about you "" persona , but he does it well .  as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here .  matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible .  this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it .  modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad .  carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now .  bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another "" dating in the 90s "" movie .  when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not .  even more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth .  it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser .  even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children .  any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue .  it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough .  there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching .  bye bye love is a genuine shame .

"the tagline on random hearts reads "" in a perfect world , they never would have met . ""  in a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie .  the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production .  dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department .  kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire .  although they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs .  dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair .  the rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process .  two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film .  dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare .  all the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter .  kay's distraction from the film's primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal .  these sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers .  random hearts' two primary characters seem to live in shells .  although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other .  there is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships .  veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both .  other than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts .  however , it is also hard to compliment it .  had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be .

"in french , the phrase "" film noir "" literally means "" black film .

""  based on "" just another sucker , "" a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , "" palmetto "" shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance .  director volker schlondorff ( "" tin drum , "" the handmaid's tale "" ) stated "" we weren't even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy . ""  it shows .   "" palmetto "" is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy .  the story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison .  someone turned state's witness and revealed that harry was framed , a "" reward "" for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto .  bitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto .  while hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth .  harry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket .  no problem , though .  the radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry .  rhea needs "" a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom "" for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny . )  the girls want to bilk a half-million dollar "" ransom "" from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam .  things go wrong , of course .  odette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks .  in an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d . a . 's  office .  they need a press liaison to field questions about odette's kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job .  not a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone .  the actors don't know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further .  as if that wasn't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic .  woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts , but he's lost here .  presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged , it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme .  harrelson clearly doesn't know what to do with harry's character , so he spends most of the film glowering , sweating and generally acting miserable .  meanwhile , elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance , behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide .  as the stepdaughter , chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr . despite a number of steamy scenes , there's no chemistry between harrelson and the women .  to make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's lips are running over each others bodies .  two particularly bad scenes highlight the film's problems .  while driving with a body in his trunk , harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up .  the officer wants to help change harry's flat tire and asks him to open the trunk .  harry's pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy , but under schlondorff's grim direction , the scene is just embarrassing .  the film's nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina .  we're supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid , but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip .  had "" palmetto "" been played with tongue firmly in cheek , it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story .  but under the harsh direction of schlondorff , the film is just a sluggish paint-by-numbers exercise in neo- noir cluelessness .  avoid this nonsense and go see "" l . a . confidential "" instead .

"fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen .  the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl .  some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard .  and what's more , this beast is heading for new york .  gulp !  although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie .  the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies .  broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image .  while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither .  also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting .  she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap .  it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent .  shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film .  hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture .  also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter .  o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies .  but what about the script ?  well , that's not up to par either .  emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script .  the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) ,  broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . )  also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour .  the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert .   ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene !  ha ha ha ha ! . )  the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e .  velicorapters ) running around new york .  right , so the script and acting suck .  but what about the special effects ?  thankfully , they're are quite good .  godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark .  the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell .  but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie .  the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending .  and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel .  let's just hope one never arrives .

'  there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .  it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves .  if the film looks familiar , that is because "" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) "" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with .  alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral .  wayne wang's ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey .  pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills .  the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life .  the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .  so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner .  adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive .  daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .  during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel .  with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla .  during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s .  eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .  but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional .  when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly .  the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .  i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself .  mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part .  but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .  she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do .  this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way .  this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .

"movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ?  the script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ?  there are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show , for instance ) . ?  six days , seven nights is simply a waste .  let's see .   .   .  we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island . ?  so , how do we do that ? ?  well , we'll make her a feisty magazine editor , and we'll make him a crusty old pilot . ?  but wait , she has to have a fianc ? e ; that can be david schwimmer . ?  but wait , if she has a fianc ? e , how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ? ?  i know ! ?  they'll get to their vacation spot , and then she'll get called back ! ?  yessssss ! ?  so , they'll crash on the island , and that will be funny for about five minutes . ?  shucks .  oh , i've got it ! ?  we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty . ?  then , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ?  then , for no obvious reason , they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them . ?  oh , yes ! ?  i feel so good about this story . ?  instead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ?  imagine that .  don't get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ?  the sparks fly between them , and so most of browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer force of talent .   ? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ?  schwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ?  and reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ?  even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences .  it's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ?  the picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ?  the ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , "" why did you pick this awful script ! ? "" ?  the film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ?  for instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ?  this is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ?  in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story .  this is summer movie season , but that doesn't mean our movies have to be dumb . ?  1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters . ?  when i was in line for six days , seven nights , i heard the woman in front of me ask for "" two tickets to that new harrison ford movie . ""   ? why didn't she know the name of the film ? ?  i suppose she just didn't care .   ? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don't realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ?  good actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash , they least they could do is assume that we'd like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents .

"you'd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games .  it hasn't worked so far .   "" street fighter ? ""   "" super mario brothers ? ""   "" wing commander ? ""   "" mortal kombat ? ""  not a watchable film in the bunch .  still i held out some hope for "" tomb raider . ""  after all , the game's premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies , so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept .  however , despite the potential of the project , "" tomb raider "" proves to be yet another bomb .  the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies .  there's a once-ever-5000-years alignment of planets coming up , and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world .  of course , the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world .  our heroine , lady lara croft ( angelina jolie ) , finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father ( jon voight ) dug up .  she figures that if she gets the triangle , she can bring her dad back from the dead .  of course , no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway .  in both video games and action movies , the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences .  however , the action in "" tomb raider "" shows little style or originality .  there's lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin' , but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct-to-cable flick .  the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer , "" the mummy returns , "" was much better ; it had its flaws , but its action was creative and large-scale .  since winning her academy award for "" girl , interrupted , "" jolie hasn't taken any projects that would display her acting talents .   "" tomb raider "" seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts ; so much attention is drawn to them that it's a shame there's no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra .  while we don't see much of her acting ability ( with the exception of a wonderful upper-crust british accent ) , we do get a hint of jolie's less savory side .  considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death , having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father ( and uninterested in any of the living males around her ) seems a poor choice .  having jolie's real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier .  i haven't decided what to make of director simon west yet .  his first feature was the star-studded disaster "" con air , "" but my opinion of him improved with "" the general's daughter , "" which was thick with sultry atmosphere .  now this train wreck .  i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series "" the prisoner . ""  hollywood has already screwed up "" the avengers , "" and "" the prisoner "" represents a chance for redemption .   ( by the way , speaking of british tv , "" red dwarf "" fans should look for chris "" rimmer "" barrie in his first major film role ) .  ",0
"an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london .  where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms .  where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny .  in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) .  the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping .  soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all .  she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) .  serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out .  however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't .  she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself .  actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie .  she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate .  this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience .  delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her .  delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise .  she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both .  given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives .  it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss .  and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts .  the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay .  tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie .  it would be kind to call him bland .  actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy's friends , are no more impressive .  julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat .  and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal .  on the technical side , it's all bad news .  the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal .  the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits .  repeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" , an infrared wolf's point-of-view approach that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed , then becomes tedious .  and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to .  director anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel .  as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf .   ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a "" bad movie "" sort of way , but that's a dubious distinction .  ultimately , it's an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn't unbearable to sit through , it isn't a howl , either .

"by starring in amy heckerling's "" clueless "" two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn't just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of "" the crush "" -- out of the water .  her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june's "" batman & robin , "" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl .  now , she's the star and producer of "" excess baggage , "" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level .  silverstone's emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally .  in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw .  but before the police can "" rescue "" her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who's still trapped in the back .  when vincent discovers emily , the two don't exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there .  along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation .  it doesn't help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who's wise to his niece's ploys for attention and has mafia connections .  for at least a half-hour , "" excess baggage "" bounces along fast and efficiently .  during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor .  but once it's past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once .  a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and "" excess baggage "" likely covers its territory .  of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome .   "" do you like my tummy ? ""  emily coos to vincent at one point in the film .  huh ?  did i miss something ?  the hard-edged , foul-mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo-goo eyes .  then again , "" excess baggage "" becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise .  a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn't game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded .  motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative .  scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions .   "" excess baggage "" has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand .  i loved silverstone's turn in "" clueless "" as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen's "" emma . ""  looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it's simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for "" excess baggage . ""  sadly , however , "" excess baggage "" is no "" clueless . ""  but , on the other hand , it is clueless .  ",0
"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film !  regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words .  you have to see it and experience it for yourself .  here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so .  yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure .  in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story .  don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off .  it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was .  it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme .  it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark .  as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness .  now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess .  i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off .  for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing .  i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) .  i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film .  ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem .  rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film .  lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once !  in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do .  in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense .  but what a strange mess it is .  it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours .  can this be the same man ?  i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time .  knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here .  for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong .  why ?  who knows .  what are the implications of this ?  i have no idea .  most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem .  knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut .  the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity .  sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this .  van damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) .  the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time .  tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison .  they're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe .  but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed .  lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character .  but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ?  i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought .  knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania .  if it were boring , i'd give it zero stars .  but it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent .  it's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny .  a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted .  i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm .  oh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts .  it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful .

"warner brothers has scored another marketing coup .  the one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever .  trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel .  carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy .  ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment .  he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome .  the opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon .   ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws .  hint : it sounds like splat . )  the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat .  with his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes .  the rest of the film is just more of the same .  sure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ?  writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups .  instead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny .  the better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see .  though an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten .  the script is virtually devoid of wit .  tribal mask jokes ?  jerry lewis cameos ?  forget it .  if anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor's ultimate challenge .  just how long * can * they keep a straight face ?

"synopsis : in "" sooner than you think "" america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs .  a dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them .  comments : so , what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ?  why , they're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks !  they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron's aliens .  yes , it's blade squad , the fox network's wednesday night movie of the week .  this "" movie , "" marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars .   "" how can a movie have guest stars ? ""  you may ask .  well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie .  blade squad is dumb .  blade squad is loud .  blade squad is obnoxious .  blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series .  why not ?  after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past .  so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ?  to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable .  the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested .  i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it .  i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad .  i can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11 .  and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning ) .  but , i digress .  despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series .  one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background .  oh yeah , dylan's "" knockin' on heaven's door "" and bowie's "" i'm afraid of americans "" are used here , in rather poor taste .  two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound .  the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end .  characters' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible .  during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background .  when a character spoke , the song's volume dropped but did not disappear .  as soon as that character finished speaking , the song's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke .  this sounds trivial , i'm sure , but it distracted me immensely .  finally , this is commercial television .  foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television .  thus , don't use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner .  in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets .  when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car's horn off-screen to muffle the word out .  in a "" seinfeld "" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably .  perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics' 2099 series of comics .  make up a bunch of new bad words for the future .  this way , you don't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language .  compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp .  when compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs .

"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller .  some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may .  both those films were tense exercises in chills .  the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer .  but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively .  for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed .  each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot .  they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay .  the thrills all came from the plot .  ronin is like a film made by another man .  somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it .  we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure .  the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai .  when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west .  if you miss the opening , do not worry .  this film will explain again what a ronin is .  sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin .  he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer .  he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france .  sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case .  dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case .  sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) .  also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) .  the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise .  their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team .  the story is not very easy to follow .  it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom .  somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case .  some very good actors are involved in this film .  one wonders what they saw in the script .  the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers .  they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed .  by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody .  maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create .  in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) .  as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy .  unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it .  i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin .  also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet .  this is the first blow of the 47 ronin .

"the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties .  produce something , anything , that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens .  the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here .  gross humor , sex jokes , silly sight gags , more sex jokes .  and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder , grosser and more outrageous than that last film .  what the film is not , however , is funny .  the plot centers around the return of dr . evil , who goes back in time to steal austin powers' mojo ( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin's pelvis ) which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies .  austin must go after him , and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday .  i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original .  but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews .  i wish i had stuck to my first impression .  myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation .  and he has the talent to do it , at least as an actor .  but the material he is working with here , much of it his own , falls short of anything resembling comic genius .  this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces , a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack , and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old .  after some of these scenes , one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention .  the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor .  for the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show .  there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety .  the director just throws the material at us , giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director .  i am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd , at least the one's who have yet to discover literacy .  certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in your face , kick you in the teeth , take no prisoners , ( action-verb +blah blah blah ) . '  if you see the film and you find you're not laughing , there is nothing wrong with you .  it just means you grew up since seventh grade .  ",0
"a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets .  the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities .  the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were .  on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast .  but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud .  i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade .  he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be .  but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch .  leonardo's rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud's poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring .  the film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems .  he accepts verlaine's praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville .  once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine's busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family's money , even though he has nothing else in common with her .  when verlaine states , "" poets can learn from one another , "" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , "" only if they're bad poets . ""  he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship .  verlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud .  when mathilde's father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers .  it's a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce .  in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail .  while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 .  he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 .  the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying .  the film ends on a whimper . . . with  verlaine talking with rimbaud's sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published .  this film was especially annoying because rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry .  i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn't work .  it certainly didn't bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry .

"it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film .  they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .   ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . )  they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact .  bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet .  why an oil driller ?  they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .   ( in one unintentionally ( ? )  hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .  we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? )  harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .  once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .  whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal .  nor will you care .  i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .  willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .  their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material .  steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic .   "" rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film .  so why did they bring him up there to begin with ?  rather , why write him into the film ? -give  his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .  i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue .  liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack .  director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen .   ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . )  whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! ""  i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood .  armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .  it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework .  it has a vivid soundmix .  but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story .  the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever .  bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler .  remember a little film called jaws ?  in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .  they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another .  one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .  this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .  not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before "" action "" was called .  a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .  to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse .  and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

"girl 6 is , in a word , a mess .  i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film .  there was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative .  if there was a point to the film , i missed it .  girl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers .  the plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator .  she begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her .  also , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) .  he is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him .  her neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 .  he also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex .  the soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring .  it kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting .  for parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background .  in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting .  of course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music .  prince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans .  of the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy .  he was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 .  he should have stuck to acting in this film .  there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up .  there are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers .  in that film , they worked to propel the narrative .  in this film , they just made me more confused .  there are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become .  other than that , though , nothing much happens .  there are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster .  i'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past .  in girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering .  he had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there .  girl 6 earns a grade of d .

"i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984's "" the company of wolves , "" to 1992's "" the crying game , "" and 1994's "" interview with a vampire . ""  his latest film , "" the butcher boy , "" is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming .  told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life .  his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore .  francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder .  the premise of , "" the butcher boy , "" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works .  francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him .  this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well .  the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay .  the supporting characters are no help , though .  rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter .  he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout .  shaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her .  and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice .  the pacing is all off in , "" the butcher boy . ""  although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while .  it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs .  at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it .  i'd rather think of , "" the butcher boy , "" as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire .  he has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film .  what could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore .

"there's a good , and timely , story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first , a new movie about the abuses of our prison system .  with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy , this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies--a point of view .  but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious , often nauseating , camera movements and slick , mtv- style lighting and editing are far more important .  there's not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling .  and everything suffers .  christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate , respectively .  after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape , bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial .  his young lawyer ( slater ) is fresh out of law school but determined to "" put alcatraz on trial "" for the abuses of it warden ( gary oldman ) .  the result is the usual courtroom theatrics- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students .  there's very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon's earnest overacting and the appropriate story .  there's a lot of overacting from everyone--you know you're in trouble right away when r . lee ermey ( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket ) is cast as a judge , the center of reason and moderation .  slater has never been convincing and certainly isn't here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances .  but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story .  there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters , let alone with them .  how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions .  if there's anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world , it is our ability to tell a good story .  have we forgotten ?

"american pie 2 is filled with laughs .  but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater .  i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy .  but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself .  what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart .  of the original , i noted it was "" a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up .

"" , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as "" the godfather , "" "" goodfellas "" and "" casino "" .  at 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep .  but by my account , i think that my laff-o-meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle .  i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film .   "" mafia ! ""  chronicles vincenzo cortino's ( lloyd bridges ) life .  separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life .  but as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord .  following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) .  like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women .   "" mafia ! "" is co-written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut-busting funny spoofs such as "" airplane "" and "" the naked gun . ""  but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work .  as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based .  crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence .  it's a tough genre to parody .  i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say "" please "" as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored .  there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter-in-law .  a gunman shoots him several times .  the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena .  i think that i just gave away the best part of the film .  oh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier .

"the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results .  when anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king's ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler .  meanwhile , the king's prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne .  the last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king's son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim .  not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i's problems could fill the blank pages of a journal .  i will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail .  the screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , "" etc , etc , etc , "" i would cringe .  literally .  speaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking .  besides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical .  the sole song which is used cleverly is "" getting to know you , "" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to .  unlike disney animated features , the king and i's songs don't add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be .  take the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i's music is at its worst .  you're being hunted by a dragon !  what do you do ! ?  sing a happy song !  martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don't make a positive ?  believe it !  with the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says "" etc . , etc . , etc . , "" more and more as the film progresses .  no personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end .  and where does this character's personality change ?  hey , i thought anna was supposed to change him !  isn't that the whole plot ?  the prime minister's hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no !  another one of his teeth fell out !  hardy-har-har !  he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him .  by the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation .  animated films , such as 1994's the lion king and 1998's the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time .  the animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds .  i have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting .  if it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , "" worst movie of the decade . ""  instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year's worst .  the bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs .  not even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it .  not the slightest bit .

"for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what's left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things .  as a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor .  an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck .  generally , though , the actor doesn't matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz .  the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less .  russell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought .  the movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we're into todd's later years .  he's about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth .  the pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he's the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie's start .  between the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it's possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction .  director paul anderson , who helmed last year's icy thriller , event horizon , doesn't show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam .  todd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a "" routine patrol "" and set the stage for the final firefight .  events are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here .  the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry .  it's not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it .  the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier .  a strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television .

"if you have ever seen fox tv's special car chase programs , you'll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action "" thriller "" from director john frankenheimer .  the film involves a mysterious briefcase , that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on .  an irish women , dierdre ( played by the truman show's natascha mcelhone ) , hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase .  among the people she hires are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunting ) .  dierdre's groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it .  they accomplish this task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again .  the briefcase stays on the run , as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed .  the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie , but failed to understand that just because there are surprises , it doesn't add too the credibility of a senseless script .  the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on , after the apparent climax of the film .  but to add to the excitement , as i mentioned earlier , there are endless car chase scenes .  they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story .  don't get me wrong , i love car chases , but they were overdone and too long here .  we never do find out what's in the briefcase , but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller .

"so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again .  that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the "" odd couple "" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's "" grumpy old men , "" 1995's "" grumpier old men , "" and 1997's "" out to sea "" ( i . e .   "" grumpiest old men "" ) .  so , "" the odd couple ii "" ( i . e .   "" the grumpiest old men of all , really "" ) seems just another entry in a tired series .  the plot is even similar to that of "" grumpy old men "" in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children .  oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car .   .   .  then hilarity ensues .  well , a few chuckles ensue anyway .  neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end .  unlike the original play/movie , "" odd couple ii "" doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters .  instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of "" cybill "" and jean smart of "" designing women "" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert .  the original 1968 movie "" the odd couple "" remains a classic comedy .  it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since .  it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's "" the fortune cookie "" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , "" the front page "" ( 1974 ) and "" buddy buddy "" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways .  the reunion of lemmon and matthau in "" grumpy old men "" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie .  but "" out to sea "" and "" the odd couple ii "" are just beating a grumpy old horse .   ( you can add lemmon's "" my fellow americans , "" i . e .   "" grumpy old presidents , "" to that list , too . )  let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do .  let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's "" lost in yonkers "" ) .

"don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood .  his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings .  but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself .  jovovich , besson's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) .  and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one .  leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side .  besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject .  yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences .  the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as "" the conscience "" ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal .  that's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness .  that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who's about to take a fall .  as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance .  trouble is , he's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on .  this glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema .  compared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history .  -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france/usa , 1999  theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 --------------------------------------------------------------  ",0
"this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company .  based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) .  when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador .  her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages .  she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead .  meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her .  however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire !  this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' .  it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written .  newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad .  kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script .  the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing .  in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements .  however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades .  an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline .  its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next !  jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile .  a complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies .  it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 !  avoid at all costs !

"synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii .  rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action .  danny falls in love with rafe's girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend .  meanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . .  review : "" pearl harbor "" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art .  it is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart .  it is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them .  sadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing "" pearl harbor "" with his left .  the plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop .  there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii .  instead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , "" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant "" , i nearly fell out of my seat ) .  to the movie's credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war .  if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching .

"one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film .  after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave .  he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing .  however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year .  the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation .  these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly .  it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : "" it's only when things are over that they make sense . ""  whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided .  the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone .  instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last .  only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it .  but don't fret , it will surface again .  you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile .  but you hold hope for some time .  the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations .  it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope .  and with speeches like , "" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , "" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ?  to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene .  the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful .  watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him .  and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities .  the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them .  unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene .  sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words .  the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image .  you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners .  the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies .  steven spielberg is picked on in particular .  while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood .  it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .  the days of breathless are no more .

"isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than "" it sucks "" ?  one of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie .  i can't seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although "" boring , "" "" stupid "" and "" absurd "" doesn't amount to much of a review .  a shame .  i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate .  but c'est la vie .  here goes nothing .  i'll keep it short .  i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee .  the film's fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a particular movie .  hill's and mgm's actions were prudent .  when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident , a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer , for some reason ( james spader ) is forced to take command .  the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and , on arrival , picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony .  one of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means .  this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it .  another one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups .  evidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger .  how ?  why ?  the movie never bothers to explain .  soon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli .  to be honest , i don't even remember exactly why .  i just remember that i didn't care .  supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas , such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb , but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing .  in fact , everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set .  well , the effects are good , though there's hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i'm not sure whether that's so remarkable an accomplishment .  the performances are hardly worth talking about .  i'm not even sure i can call what's here "" performances , "" though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger .  james spader is not a bad actor , but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i've seen in a while , mostly because he isn't given a character with a personality .  the action scenes are just as bland , since they're pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren't particularly entertaining the first time around .  and since the action scenes are everything to this movie , it's pretty much dead in the water .  and for the life of me , i can't figure out why it's called supernova .

"a new entry in the "" revisionist history "" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal .  kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in .  when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers .  the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with .  when they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned .  during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president's resignation .  this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of "" deep throat "" .  from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad "" dick "" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy .  at one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial .  the band manages to stop right as dunst screams "" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! ""  much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot .  several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film .  if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it's juvenile bathroom humor , but it's not .  the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience's throat in the least subtle way possible .  i don't recall oliver stone's nixon having to pander to it's audience , but of course that film wasn't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience .  the only redeeming thing about this movie is it's remarkable supporting cast .  i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch's woodward and bernstein .  those two characters are the sole basis for my rating .  i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour .  their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch's constant thwarting of ferrell's attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy's brother ) .  the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with .  i'd like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities .  as for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better .  they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best .  stay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie .  an excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie .  less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds .  as it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as "" dick and poopie "" jokes .  and that , to me , does not make a funny movie .

"there isn't much good about this movie .  not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie .  so i'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn't direct it or it would be titled "" technicolor city "" .  in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end .  the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie .  the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum .  john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything .  john must find out who he is before the "" strangers "" ( a . k . a .  mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy .  during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people .  any of these points however are completely "" erased "" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script .  as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film .  the acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care .  the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true "" b-movie "" .  the direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly .  lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn't deserve to have the word "" science "" in science-fiction .  if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie .  lets hope the next movie by alex "" i wish i was tim burton "" proyas is at least tolerable .

"synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur .  unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way .  comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video .  their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) .  stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) .  other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable .  stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do .  interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen .  after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears .  the narrator states that "" this is the story of daryl gleason "" and tells the audience that he is the stalker .  of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels .  if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked .  okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required .  stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious .  the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together .  daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her .  ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate .  these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet .  for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked .  stalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) .  events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) .  stalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either .  jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much .  he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands .  maryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the "" stalked "" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner .  brooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed .  toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl .  to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house .  does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ?  of course not .  she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house .  when daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger .  somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside .  the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence .  stalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched .  rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are .  if you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else .

"under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review .  however , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary .  even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk .  the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm's past patients .  distraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself .  cut to the "" next fall "" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) .  after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has "" the sixth sense "" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead .  and this , as they say , is where the healing begins .  the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of "" siskel and ebert "" ) .  although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one .  here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated .  and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment .  stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion .  after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power .  it's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie .  in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come .  and when the final moments do come , it's a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all .  it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level .  i won't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder .  now , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand .  however , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few "" twilight zone "" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away .  the fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped .  ironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl's funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy .  i wouldn't have even known about this mental disease if i hadn't , by pure dumb luck , caught "" dateline nbc "" the other week when they did a feature story on it .  despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn't plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species .  squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) .  miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round .  so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid .  the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can .  in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna .  patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring .  and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- "" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable "" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction .  species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around .  however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered .  mr . brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches .  like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious .  last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- "" something bad happened here . ""  this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter "" this is awful . ""  and she's not even empathic !  and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , "" he's going to rape her . ""  while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own .  there's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( "" he's in aisle 1 ! ""  informs eve ) .  if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion .  much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief .  the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve's brain ?  why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ?  my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks .  this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public .  returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis .  mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film .  mr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) .  ms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that "" she's so empowered . ""  a lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that's * what i call empowerment .  ",0
"it's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( "" the matrix , "" "" existenz "" ) would collide with the even more popular serial-killer genre ( "" kiss the girls , "" "" se7en "" ) .  the result should have been more interesting than "" the cell . ""  as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained .  after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report .  meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim .  his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them .  he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning .  although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast .  not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma .  from the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction .  to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking .  so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time .  the focus of "" the cell "" in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality .  for the most part , it's style without substance .  in his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father .  all in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development .  singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem's "" losing my religion , "" and "" the cell "" seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted .  singer lopez seems to think she's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting .  the premise had great promise .  the computer-generated world within carl's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic .  the first room catharine enters in carl's head shows this promise .  she finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments .  the panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse .  this scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder .  another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath .  their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine's own psyche .  like sidney lumet's "" the offence "" or michael mann's "" manhunter , "" "" the cell "" could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator .  however , catharine's character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role .  bottom line : don't get trapped in this one .

"august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children's films , and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don't want to see slaughtered against family-oriented thanksgiving films .  last year , the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon , and this year , they bestow max keeble's big move on delighted moviegoers across the country .  parents will be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did .  don't get me wrong - keeble , which is actually only a "" ment "" away from being a fetish film , isn't that entertaining .  in fact , you'd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics ( monsters , inc . , harry potter ) come out next month .  but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy , then you'd better do it ( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn't going to cut it ) .  we first see young max keeble ( alex d . linz , home alone 3 ) as a pint-sized superhero , delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross , foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man ( jamie kennedy , jay and silent bob strike back ) and landing the neighborhood honey ( brooke anne smith ) , who , by the way , is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day .  the scenario is , of course , a dream .  max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude , no luck with the ladies and only two friends , both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts ( and who were both in snow day ) - the perpetually robed robe ( josh peck ) and a clarinet-playing cutie named megan ( summer catch's zena grey ) , who harbors secret feelings for max .  things don't get any better for max when he arrives at school .  he has to contend with , among other things , a red-hot science teacher ( amber valletta , family man ) , a pair of polar-opposite bullies ( noel fisher and orlando brown ) , and an illiterate principal ( larry miller , the princess diaries ) who's secretly diverting the school's last dime into the football program .  when max's father ( grownup nerd robert carradine ) unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week , max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off .  whoa - don't worry , parents .  he doesn't do it klebold-harris style .  it's all pretty tame stuff , but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move , leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings .  director tim hill ( muppets from space ) adds a few nice touches , like max's voiceover character introductions for the film's main characters and a flashback scene that's pretty funny , but there isn't too much else happening here stylewise . . . unless  you count some farting , a little puking , and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk and lil' romeo .  1 : 30 - pg for some bullying and crude humor  ",0
"these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows .  most of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past .  but , some five or six years ago , there weren't that many movies and the trend didn't look that depressing .  so , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about "" modern stone age "" family , weren't particularly worried when the word came about live action remake .  after all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good .  the plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age "" town "" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america .  fred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o'donnell ) to adopt a baby .  to return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management .  but , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme .  in the meantime , fred's wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can't stand fred .  on the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life .  computer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show .  unfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o'donnell .  but the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot .  some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film .  result is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as "" high concept "" .  after great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version .  all in all , film isn't that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it .

"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches .  there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics .  spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story .  but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken .  in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films .  _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day .  ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers .  the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france .  there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie .  the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done .  the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat .  another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops .  the technical side of the film is peerless , as always .  the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw .  hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel .  yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events .  it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince .  throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) .  for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground .  here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man .  but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact .  there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) .  the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film .  ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war .  rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is "" realistic , "" it would be better to describe it as "" having realistic moments . ""  another aspect of the "" hollywoodization "" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing .  anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup .   "" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? ""  asks one infantrymen in the group of eight .  rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as "" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? ""  or some variant thereof .  conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "" f "" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex .  this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an "" r "" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film .  however , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic .  the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg .  he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it .  as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain .  that particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film .  nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) .  because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows .   .

"if you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ?  if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ?  while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people .  what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation .  celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he's familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows .  allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more .  branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery .  the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another .  unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity .  aside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless .  branagh proves once again that he's a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly .  the problem is that he's the same character allen always plays , a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch .  i mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ?  -- he hates his work , and he can't be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved .  he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it's pretty hard to care about him .  in addition , isn't allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him ?  i know he is , but he didn't do it in celebrity .  the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances .  davis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie .  some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they're not likable people .  only famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon's new novel , has any life .  the men in the picture don't do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging .  what's really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its "" themes "" are .  allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie about the way "" normal "" people look at celebrities .  the main problem with this is that the character with whom we're supposed to identify , simon , is not a "" normal "" guy -- he's just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters .  the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue .  in addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , "" it's interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! "" ) .  celebrity is arguably allen's biggest misfire to date .  it does have a few good scenes -- theron's super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two .  but celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen's point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends .  if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that .  i , for one , don't enjoy feeling like an outsider .

"ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life .  unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie .  actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie .  not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video .  it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house .  but no one has arrived yet .  her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups .  some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers .  but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end .  those who are invited are the ones that have the issues .  it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms .  first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof .  he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production .  bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them .  they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections .  he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school .  his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch .  as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy .  moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts .  val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene .  on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find .  paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds .  of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot .  wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless .  paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship .  however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening .  finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film .  jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before .  while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy .  very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory .  however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted .  instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies .  first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot .  at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot .  there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish .  not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver .  and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots .  perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end .  but it didn't happen that way .  the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .

"if the 70's nostalgia didn't make you feel old , the 80's nostalgia is bound to .  one of the latter set , "" the wedding singer , "" seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980's directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine .  the wacky fashions are here .   .   .  and the music .   .   .  and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle .  the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings .  both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds .  robbie and julia go through the expected ups-and-downs as they realize they were meant to be together .  i'll fess up-i've never found adam sandler funny .  whatever his appeal is , i've missed it .   ( other comedians i don't get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments ) .  the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself .  idol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup .  he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene .  we're not supposed to notice that , and we're not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie .  other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie .  lovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie's post-break-up depression .

"the ads make "" hanging up "" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters .  anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed .  all of the movie's funny scenes were included in the ad .  so what do we get ?  eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital .  once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife .  his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy .  now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly .  eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them .  both are slow to show concern .  so devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) .   ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . )  the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker .  there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's "" king lear "" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life .  sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team .  henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including "" desk set "" and "" there's no business like show business . ""   ( delia's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) .  surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic's wet dream .  the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available .  yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters .  also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial .  eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can't feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day .  georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile .  when we first meet maddy , she's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream .  i expected to see the credit "" cinematography by 'vanity fair . ' ""  and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow's mother .  to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off .  the one redeeming aspect of "" hanging up "" is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings .  there's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant .  my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine .   ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) .  if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters' mother pat .  in a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn't love her .  although leachman is best known for comedies like "" young frankenstein "" and "" the mary tyler moore show , "" her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in "" the last picture show .

"a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge .  at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise .  after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom .  the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . .  and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) ,  love .  so far , so mediocre .  but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance .  it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status .  this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture .  but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand .  not that there is much of a romance to begin with .  try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters .  celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard .  as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other .  when celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural .  but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish .  boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting .  the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling .  and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue .  watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool .  instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name .  my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing "" beyond the sea "" at a karaoke bar .  after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter .  the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport .  alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end .  i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill .  a life less ordinary certainly delivers something "" different , "" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary .

"one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances .  now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this .  o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company .  he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her .  his reasons ?  well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . . .  i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) .  eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever .  he essentially says to her , "" you win "" and hands her a ring .  the audience should now hate this character .  i did .  then the meat of the plot presents itself .  jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business .  however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) .  having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition "" .  the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly .  it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point .  ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster's millions ? "" .  as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says "" what is this , brewster's millions ? ""  it was quite surreal .  something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive .  up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his "" business proposition "" which i felt was good .  at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers .  when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story .  at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride .  these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman .  when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them .  as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off .  this goes on for the rest of the film .  it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women .  my groans of disgust could be heard for miles .  the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i'm still groaning .  the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video .  it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features .  the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film .  apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses .  so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ?  ugh .

"it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 .  mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films .  fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles .  this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was .  william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us .   ( at least in the movies anyway . )  it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor .  charlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family .  apparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling .  so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge .  this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again .  one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood .  fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort .  while they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film .  with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes .  one bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend .  it's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film .  ragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original .  roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie .  i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way .  the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video .  never a good thing for a horror film .  another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare .  for that matter , they were almost nonexistent .  if i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice .  the first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list .  if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes .  either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation .

"guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living .  but i know so well that it's a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt .  verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies .  the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year .  a simple , white on black title card reads "" starship troopers "" -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits .  is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ?  were the rest of the film that subdued . . .  starship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names .  they graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet .  the story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it's akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue .   ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn't changed in the future . )  one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future .  hysterically funny , actually .  but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between .  the storytelling lacks focus , to say the least .  the politics of the film are scary .  the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos .  there's even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it .  i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i've encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders .  of course , verhoeven's probably the one to blame , and perhaps i'm jealous because i'm so disgusting .  at any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn't be about sex .  exactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving .  and r-rated , despite its goofy premise .  maybe it's asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he's a master of insipid violence .  however , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it .

"_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it .  i could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment .  if there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day .  the story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? )  after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy .  who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys .  after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat .  there's a new wrinkle , though .  todd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place .  after losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet .  if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you're way ahead of the game .  the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute .  it's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples .  unlike that mind-twisting classic , this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages .  add into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction , and it's easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad .  and the special effects !  remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ?  gary busey is in this movie .  'nuff said .  _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults .  that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all .  now if you'll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future .

"has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ?  in enemy of the state , that is exactly right .  a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997's lame brained men in black .  will this guy ever get a real role ?  he has the bruce willis syndrome .  the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands .  he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . . you  know .  enemy was one of the worst films of last year .  not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight , the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i didn't like how smith always magically out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck .  enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection .  i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me .  somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity .

"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air .  the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl .  the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met .  if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should .  cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained .  and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough .  cage should have known what he was getting himself into .  he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production .  the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance .  in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time .  that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness .  while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact .  audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production .  in fact , the marketing people are counting on it .  no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded .  director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) .  what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense .  a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely .  if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up .  at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool .  their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) .  in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts .  it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance .  while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep .  his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies .  it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over .  there's a word for people like you , nicolas .  that word is called recidivist . . . repeat  offender .

"in my review of "" the spy who shagged me , "" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore .  the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing .   "" scream 3 "" provides the latest proof of this rule .  in los angeles production has begun on "" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , "" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) .  however , life soon starts imitating art , and "" stab "" cast members turn up stabbed .  smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in "" stab 3 . "" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name .   .   .  until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice .  the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy .  he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with .  indeed , "" scream 3 "" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original "" scream . ""  at the scene of each murder in "" scream 3 , "" the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer .  to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films .   ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is ) .  unlike its predecessors , "" scream 3 "" doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer .  the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is .  the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ?  the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ?  the driven young director ( scott foley ) ?  the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ?  the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random .  wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen .  the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious .  possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche .  i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first "" scream "" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home .  at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas .   "" scream 3 "" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles .  look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from "" seinfeld "" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point .  all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- "" scream "" job search .  another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying "" the blair witch project "" 's web strategy .   "" scream 3 "" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie .  the sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the "" latest 'stab 3' news . ""  there's also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more "" stab "" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) .  craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the "" scream "" series .  while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters .  there's a "" halloween h2k "" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in "" h20 , "" and a "" freddy vs . jason "" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were "" killed off . ""  there's bound to be a "" scream 4 "" someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes .  bottom line : they should have called this one "" yawn . ""  ",0

"one of my brother's favorite movies is h . b . halicki's 1974 cult flick "" gone is sixty seconds , "" one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's .  chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal .  although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of "" gone in sixty seconds "" is relatively weak and dull .  randall "" memphis "" raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track .  he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars .  however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he's in big trouble .  kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week .  calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip's bargain ; if he doesn't come through , kip dies .  memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j .  cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) .  as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who's still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri's clients .  watching "" gone , "" i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one .  maybe that's why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for "" eleanor , "" a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis .  but the big chase doesn't live up to the long wait .  i had high hopes for "" gone "" because it is director dominic sena's second film .

"the general's daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters .  director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth .  what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm .  john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) .  brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) .  soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who .  ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story .  perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something .  on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed .  the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and "" shocking "" plot developments .  having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree .  scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines .   ( sunderland actually asks brenner , "" why was she killed ? ""  to which i would have answered , "" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . "" )  only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored .  not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot .  in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask .  she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring .  instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap .  this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience .  it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise .  i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story .  this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct .  compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture .  these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be .  in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure .  this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up .  as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane .  perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances .  james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety .  i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous .  nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization .  the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments .

"it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch .  based on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover .  however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion .  of course , the ads make it seem like so much more .  quick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like .  sounds like a cool movie , does it not ?  after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not .  the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough .  the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half .  and with it comes every single clich ? .  it doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen .  the characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden .  claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience .  the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching .  unfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time .  with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset .  despite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset .  information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable .  the way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't .  basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) .  the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them .  it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late .  avoid this film at all costs .

"would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ?  let me tell you what reality is .  reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot .  that's reality .  america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) .  the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time .  the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) .  gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage .  veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all .   ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . )  and did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ?  and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ?  oh billy , you're a scamp !  the script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ?  and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one .  yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces !  if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine .  it's about to expire .  aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) ,  america's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself .  i didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film .  bad move , billy -- your jokes suck .  the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me .  julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here .  obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise .  none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho .  as for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work .  he's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years .  it'll probably be another 11 before he's back again .  i could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old .  instead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment .  every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains .  when you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ?

"by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered .  after all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines .  the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction .  as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects .  lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination .  all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist .  but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse .  lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .  he's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise .  two months earlier , lacrosse's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere .  lacrosse knows his killer's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game .  it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start .  there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation .  we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp .  a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film .  quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated .  it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .  even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course .  the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat .  unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal .  once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable .  in fact , "" stale and predictable "" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents .  it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film .  played with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he's a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions .  a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling .  instead , stuart places his trust in a "" name "" star who can't carry the material .  maybe next time he'll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story .

"numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers .  soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring .  the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground .  besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age .  the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography .  russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad .  besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience .  this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth .  although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable .

" "" come on , silent bob !  we're going to hollywood . ""  starring jason mewes , kevin smith , will ferrell , shannon elizabeth , seann william scott , chris rock , jason lee , ben affleck .  directed by kevin smith .  rated r .  jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior .  kevin smith , coming off the wonderful , challenging dogma , fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he's just oh-so-ironic .  but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission .  jay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith's movies but , if i'm not mistaken , have not starred in one until now .  they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood .  this presents two problems : a ) they haven't received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( "" what's the internet ? "" )  are talking trash about them .  what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ?  on the way -- they're hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ?  -- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie's angels-style outfits .  of course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film .  will ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey .  the movie will probably please only smith's die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past .  any appeal the movie has will come from the "" in "" jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is "" in "" to the point of absurdity .  there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness .  once jay and silent bob get to hollywood , the movie abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire .  countless "" hot "" movie stars and personalities make an appearance , from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven , but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low-brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer .  get it ?  they're so desperate for another movie , they ran out of ideas and used a monkey !  a monkey !  as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of , most of the really good lines are throwaways , while the big , painstaking gags mostly fall flat .  one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don't ask ) , jay responds : "" the female clitoris ? ""  kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he'd let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film .  unfortunately , it's also shapeless , pointless and largely unfunny .  smith's "" verbal trampoline , "" as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue , takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker .  this was supposed to be the movie that didn't offend anyone , but it's offensive because it's terrible .

"any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates .  frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement .  unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller .  almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities .  the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled .  unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening .  this is a very bad sign .  not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder .  of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters .  a perfect murder isn't a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) .  emily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) .  their marriage isn't going well -- emily resents steven's controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) .  when steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn't that of a typical cuckolded husband .  instead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that's too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven's new york apartment and kill emily .   ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest . )  ultimately , i'm not sure which of the three main characters we're supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair .  not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they're not interesting .   ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn't . )  steven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes .  the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks .  michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he's gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife .  gwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here .  she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998's worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) .  at least viggo mortensen ( g . i .  jane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies .  the thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of "" poirot , "" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily's best friend .  a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end .  there aren't many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start .  it's surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living .  it's just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough .

"play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie .  containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two .  rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . .  something that he has not yet successfully achieved .  rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince's ex-girlfriend , grace .  both men are nearing the end of their "" almost "" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity .  when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement .  our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is "" promised "" a shot at a future title fight .  the film is divided into two sections .  at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's "" sassy grassy "" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day .  along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .  once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar .  both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here .  mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince .  the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable .  mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar .  weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance .  the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another .  tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers .  because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins .  but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other .  writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed .  if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film .  as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable .  the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .  the phrase , "" play it to the bone' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you've achieved your desired goal .  that is a biblical principle .

"capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie .  the gags are sporadically funny .  it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes .  the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team .  the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film .  sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching .  this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night .   ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . )   , low 0 ( -4 to +4 )  a film needs a plot .  it needs characters for empathy value .  it needs a story and an emotional center .  if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are .  kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy .  with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp .  peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled .  but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it .  his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience .  jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes .  how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call .  for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny .  there was not enough cleverness or variety .  it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay .  penis jokes work only so many times .  showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags .  they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico .  jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners .  as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts .  in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads .  jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks .  this leaves them at loose ends .  they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie .  they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash .  so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way .  the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny .  silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his .  this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have .  jay has to be the comic .  he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive .  the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny .  he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair .  so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team .  their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before .  like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie .  certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving .  they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat .  it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content .  the film does not offer much to an adult audience .  i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

"the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending .  watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise .  when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification .  this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more .  good surprises make movies fun to watch .  then there are the bad twists .  you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid .  screwed perfectly suits the latter description .  what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on .  by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs .  larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing .  whoops .  screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments .  norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) .  when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars .  too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home .  now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping .  of course , everything that could go wrong does .  the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad .  but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear .  the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes .  at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : "" no , you idiot !

"what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie .  the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ?  nothing , right ?  what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ?  well . . . nothing .  so , why make it , hollywood ?  there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic .  no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this .  the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable .  but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again !  like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! )  between .  basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it .  why not walk out ?  well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie .  here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm "" . . .  first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud .  it's not easy to watch .  i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now .  the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator .  a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe .  she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead .  she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find .  family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder "" .  let me backtrack for a moment .  see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead .  however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference .  very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies .  the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on .  welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry .  you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him !  he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze .  after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films .  skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . .  led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue .  the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante .  this film doesn't draw you in .  it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ?  it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie .   "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) .  by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment .  for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled .  a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter .  writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , "" se7en "" .  director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing .  he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) .  however , gratuitous is joel's middle name .  he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint .  no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness .  he doesn't leave much to the imagination .  it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante .  the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! )  craft .  case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? )  drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) .  see . . . no  subtlety .  does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ?  who do we root for in this mess ?  is there anybody out there ?  it's not all the director's fault , though .  why did the actors sign up for this ?  nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud !  if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ?  what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ?  villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy .  and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ?  he was so solid as a concerned father in "" a civil action "" .  i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or  they're suckers .  or they just don't care .  there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland .  catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells .  baby cindy is obviously cute and wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet .  the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter .  this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like "" payback "" ( which was a much better movie ) .  the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it's rough .  during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't good and whose timing was a half-second off .  such a technical error indeed stands out .  speaking of standing out , don't believe the misleading trailers .  there's not much action here .  occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe .  after seeing "" 8mm "" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again .  is that a positive ?  well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they've done a swell job here .  it'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved .  but today i'm not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ?  i'm sure that somewhere right now there's some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn't mean i need to know about it .  yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there .  yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn't look like we expect him to .  you said all that in 1995 .  move on .  this film serves no purpose .  it doesn't entertain , it doesn't teach us anything , it doesn't make a statement beyond the obvious "" this stuff is bad "" approach .  only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile .  that's not likely to happen , though , so "" 8mm "" is indeed a scummy waste of money .  orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , "" to movies . . . to  good movies "" .  if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole .  like "" snuff "" films , "" 8mm "" should never have been made .  now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it .  useless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme .  he used it in "" batman forever "" , in "" batman & robin "" , in "" a time to kill "" , in "" falling down "" , and it's rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .

">from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong .  at reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world .  courtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school .  everyone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity .  courtney is the "" leader "" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group .  it is liz's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz .  just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else .  and also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie .  and finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth .  this time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney's group , as well as the entire school .  >from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing .  not only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast .  judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has .  also on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers .  on the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn't match her wickedly clever performance as "" tatum "" , in 1996's scream .  mcgowan's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film .  she is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her .  faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles .  when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles .  gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker .  jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in .  we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don't have anything to do with the actual film .  the beginning and ending are strong , it's just the middle that needs a lot of help .  during the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion .  nothing to grab the viewer's interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again .  jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat .  the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang .  all in all , a horrible disappointment .  the bottom line : the tagline reads , "" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside . ""  yes , that is too true .  no matter how good this film may have looked , it fails to deliver .  ",0
"plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film "" trio "" from the studio , after they complete the "" final cut "" without him .  he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision .  critique : wow .  i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels !  the "" comedy "" in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) .  the plot is uninteresting , boring and bad .  the structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious .  the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can't act to save his life .  the cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks .  all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite .  i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one .  see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it .  luckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective .  by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ?  who knows , who cares , this "" satire "" sucks the bag .  little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker .  this was after the film's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his .  the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis .  eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack .  he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him .  he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack .  this film practically swept the "" razzie awards "" in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the "" worst picture "" award , the "" worst screenplay "" ( joe eszterhas ) , the "" worst supporting actor "" ( joe eszterhas ) , the "" worst new star "" ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the "" worst original song "" ( "" i wanna be mike ovitz !

"as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother .  yanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother's face .  this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched .   ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she'd start sticking her finger in her throat .  and she's right , it is that bad . )  directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best .  boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts .  amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more .  but who's counting ?  and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic .  meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad .  it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything .  herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes "" your geyser's a geezer , "" and "" i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack . ""  as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as "" a walking kodak moment , "" are celebrating their 18th birthday .  as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski .  as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men .  as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they've got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire .  their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers .  the rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week .  hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material .  this isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in .  steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances .  the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey .  even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull .  to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog .  put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said .  although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road .  they make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt .   "" how could this possibly be worst , "" asks phil .  just when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill .  its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag .  after phil's girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm .  like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss .  as they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested .  meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half .  it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up .  my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * .  they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites .  nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo .

"it's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater .  and unfortunately with man's best friend , we'll be waiting a while longer .  the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio-genetics gone wrong .  sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a "" good "" story provokes her to snoop inside of emax , a poorly guarded million dollar bio-lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding .  the result : she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max , a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake , camouflage like a chameleon , climb trees like a leopard , and attack with the strength of tiger .  max takes a liking to sheedy , and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax , owned by henrikson .  well , it doesn't take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman , etc . . .  sheedy is a boring non-presence on the screen , tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director ( i apologize for a lack of credits .  i suppose i was eager to leave the theater , and in my rush , forgot to take note of the director , writer , producer , etc . . . ) .  henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script , giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film .  the movie depends upon it's ability to impress the audience with animal special effects , but all it presents is a dog that can growl , open door handles with his paw , sit , roll over , play dead , and sick .  the rest of the special effects were so poor , i found them offensive .  the film attains sub-mediocrity , an unambitious film at best .  horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite .

"the word to describe sharon stone is "" wonder "" .  not that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent .  she has a dynamic screen presence in "" basic instinct "" , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in "" casino "" , but possesses neither of those here .  stone teams up with private school headmaster's wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani's thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) .  in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to' [read "" steal from "" ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he's not dead or maybe . . .  kathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective .  her character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling .  adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation .  it's stone that is a disappointment among the actors .  how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ?  costumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous .  even the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out .  on the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive .  that is if you can put up with stone's cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch's movies .

" "" what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? ""  that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie .  let me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn't a bad b-movie , it's a really bad b-movie .  so bad , it's almost good .  almost , but not quite .  the movie starts off in the 1950's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth .  it is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies .  the slugs' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody .  that is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 .  he , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies .  a slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs .  it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs .  the acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse .  and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie .  the only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow .  it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it .  actually , it was the high point of the movie for me .  of course , that isn't really saying much .  the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion .  which gives it a leg up on some other horror films .  unlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story .  not a great one , but it is there .  this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980's that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies .  you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better .  but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon .  just don't be too upset if you can't find it .  you really won't be missing that much .

"what a contrast !  in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly .  i'm not sure you could get two more different movies .  while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it .  this is one interesting movie .  it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty .  there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men .  hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him .  his big question is : does it all pertain to him ?  and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ?   "" it "" means everything : television , friends , events that happen .  i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ?  this is not a movie for answers .  donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions .  that's what makes this movie stay on your mind .  these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time .  even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do .  the performances are all superb in hurlyburly .  i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this .  eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable .  i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him .  chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person .  i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend .  everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real .  it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world .  unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men .  i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing .  first , it's depressing that such a world exists .  a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings .  sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background .  second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men's world .  where are the stories about women's world ?  not the soap operas and the "" chick flicks "" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men .  hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts .  it's very talkative , intelligent and static .  while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing .  not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas .  not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience .  all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen .  it also means that you have to pay attention .

"filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea .  doug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker .  in his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director .  but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same .  his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel .  consistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives .  the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter .  in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal .  neither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes .   ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . )  the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to .  the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles .  in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success .  although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories .  go doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it .  as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme .   ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . )  at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .

"synopsis : when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert , community college professors ira kane ( duchovny ) and harry block ( jones ) are first on the scene .  they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate .  soon the army , advised by dr allison reed ( moore ) , moves in and forces kane and block out .  but when the aliens begin to menace society , it may take the scientists' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity .  review : "" evolution "" certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy .  it's directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his "" ghostbusters "" success into a twenty-first-century counterpart .  it stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his "" x-files "" character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition .  and then there's moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress .  a shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass .   "" evolution "" is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script .  it has its moments ( a scene in which jones' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour .  moore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast .  duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with .  and the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys .  part of what made "" ghostbusters "" so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for .   "" evolution "" is so mind-numbingly tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens .  ",0
"yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex .  stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored .  their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there .  one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie .  everything about it annoyed the hell out of me .  the acting , and script , the plot , and ending .  the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film .  the "" big "" stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality .  i felt like i was watching dawson's creek episode 200 .  although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast .  the "" surprise "" ending was sooo predictable .  since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ?  go is dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's all that = go home and watch something else .

"if you've seen the trailers or commercials , it's rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store .  well , it's hard to tell after watching the movie as well .  bruce willis is a resident of the future , and it is a rather bleak future .  the world's population had disintigrated into a mere 200 , 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals .  the reason ?  in 1995 , an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus , thus wiping out practically the world's population in a mere month .  bruce willis' character is one of the surviving few , but is enslaved by scientists , as are most of last living humans .  they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task : go into the past , find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys , and kill him .  well , this explanation didn't come easy .  although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people , our future and the evilo in the world , as a story it is very confusing .  and dragging .  i know a movie isn''t keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it's only been an hour passed .  terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate , and i haven't watched his previous work brazil , but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out , you wish it were more complex , and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me .

"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller .  though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough .  in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery .  he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny .  he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine .  valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive .  he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 .  seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson .  he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party .  he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it .  what a mess .  i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer .  the limey does exactly that .  the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose .  there is no method to this movie's madness .  it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably .  the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving .  this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude .  i felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck .  ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant .  sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal .  he's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here .  peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective .  he's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are .  this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion .  why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work .  the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work .  1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it .  shall we go back to basics ?

"in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .  was it "" deep "" ?  nope .  however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .  it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was "" without the comic book uplift "" of the indiana jones and superman pictures .  which was true .  if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .  if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .  some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that "" this is batman as batman should be . "" ;  mr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .  the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .  there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .  the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .  the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman's body she gets pushed off a building .  i admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess .  nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .  hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .  alas , these are only hints .  there are , don't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .  a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .

"one of these days , i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie .  king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings .  it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains .  ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen .  his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure .  when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair .  you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ?  the addiction is that movie .  walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout .  the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) .  much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill "" relationship "" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model . )  matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout .  no kidding .  requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle .  matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him .  no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon .  in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full "" dirty ol' man "" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs .  wider ! )  toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out .  something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was .  suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all .  the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea .  cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we're back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits .   "" yeah ! ! !  yeah ! ! !  arrrghhh ! ""  says mr . hopper .  dirty old sod . )  it's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny .  how's that for cryptic ?  never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he's all about .  i can picture it now .   "" take off yer clothes , kid -- it's essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you're his visual id .  you're the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture .  take it off !  take it all off ! ! !  ha ha ha ! ""  friggin' vampire .  yeah , you , ferrara .  a final word about matthew modine : he's actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there's something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor .  he's ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) .  [he was in that scene ?  -ed . ]  here , he's asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs .  he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it's somehow lacking .  modine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara's flesh fair .  better luck next time , matt .  someday , you'll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn't really your fault in the first place .  maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world .

"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality .  like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies .  consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf's tribe .  let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that's about its only asset .  the best word to describe this film is "" asinine . ""  the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty .  krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules .  the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist .  the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two .  finally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work .  once upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college .  he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a "" lost tribe "" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished .  shortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own .  now , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings .  when he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the "" shelmikedmu "" .  to provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb .  soon , much to krippendorf's surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon .  but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud .  the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt .  unfortunately , it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this .  director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags .  meanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative .  the acting in underwhelming .  dreyfuss has definitely not given his "" all "" to the role of james krippendorf .  alongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv's dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else .  this quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie .  no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen's daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels .  i know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of titanic , but seems much longer .  most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set .  if there's any upside , it's that i don't see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue .  krippendorf's tribe will quickly become extinct .

" * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once .  when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically .  such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button .  this fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu .  has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ?  attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger .  the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes .  they become walking wardrobes .  small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream "" shemp "" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder .  he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam .  though they're not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her .   ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged .  dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions .  unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . )  when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) .  although paul's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott .  she's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( "" cabaret "" ) , and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend .  cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . .   ( aside : simon & garfunkel's "" parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme "" should never have been allowed in another motion picture . )  heckerling has a lot in common with nora "" you've got mail "" ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women .  men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she's cheerily redecorating his apartment .   ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . )  goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them .  heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes .   ( consider , too , that dora is the film's sole female principal . )  not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn't .  that is her hallmark .

"welcome to your oh-so typical sequel .  it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow .  shallow . . . . hmm . . . now there's an idea .  maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better .  the first thing that struck me . . . and  surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible .  looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet . . . . . . very  different to the original movie .  the characters ?  well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown .  annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie .  why ?  because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points .  even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall .  for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces . . . . bang  bang bang  in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued .  jason patric ?  all i can say is bring back keanu .  keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump . . . but  that's one more tree stump than jason has .  i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! !  now frown ! . . . i said frown . . . . oh . . . you are . . . bang  bang bang . .  wooden just doesn't describe this guys performance , but it'll have to do .  the bad guy . . . . . ahh . . . william  dafoe - there's a bright move .  how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic , body of evidence ?   ( yes , that is sarcasm ) .  his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad . . . . but  goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses .  in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage , even though he already has the money and can escape . . . . bang  bang .  though i'd like to give this movie a double thumbs down , there were some nice sequences .  considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars - you'd hope there'd be at least a couple .  the real eye-popper for me , even though it was given away in the trailer . . . . bang  bang . . . . . was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker .  this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was . . . . completely  computer generated !  wow . . . . i  don't think i've ever seen a cg model look so real before .  the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific , and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of . . . . speed .  this lack-of-speed problem affects many sequences .  such as the oil tanker part . . . . . it was - "" oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! "" ,  20 minutes later - "" oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! ""  20 min . . . . you  get the point .  this movie failed simply because it didn't live up to it's name . . . . there  was very little feeling of speed .  in the original movie , the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive . . . . . in this movie it felt more like - "" well people , we're gonna run into that there island in a few hours - i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i can't turn off the engines . . . i'm  passing the cafeteria on the way , can i get anybody anything ? ""  the ending of this movie really is terrible .  even though it features what i've since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie - it just doesn't work at all .  the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic , but . . . . surprise  surprise - it just takes waaaaay too long .  it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped .  one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town , around 25 people are killed by the ship . . . . and  there's only 15 or so people left on the ship .  so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering - the audience is sitting back and thinking - "" wait a sec . . . this is a happy moment because ? ""  bang bang  then there was the dog . . . . . i  almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris .  putting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche . . . . . . every  movie seems to have a 'dog-in-danger' sequence - volcano , dante's peak , independence day , daylight , twister .  lost world . . . . . . etc ,  etc .  this movie is a perfect example of how not to make a sequel .  director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one back-to-back and see if he realises where he went wrong .

"i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series .  if there's a will , there's a way ; and i believe that anything , no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon .  this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on-par with an original .  but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad .  you see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection .  but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn't any good to begin with ?  that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad .  i've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn't like it all that much .  it has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn't be able to access .  obviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen ) .  the three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi .  of the three , only danes has a real character .  ribisi's dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes .  when the squad's superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations .  all kinds of good stuff !  the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments .  although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance .  epps' straight man is effectively played against ribisi's clueless spontaneity .  but the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting .  a drug-op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it's executed here , it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful .  claire danes' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained .  she could have been a tour-de-force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role .  epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected , although their characters aren't nearly as rich as danes' could have been .  the mod squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film , and teens will jump all over it .  it's full of bad dialogue , scenes and concepts that make no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time .  nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for .  claire danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible hairdo , so that draw is out .  there are , however , cool explosions , guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort .  do not be fooled .  some may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare .

"when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment .  even politicians ( ! )  tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "" filth "" like pulp fiction .  these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be .  thusly patch adams isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation .  similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess .  the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world .  12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we're all living in a frank capra movie .  meanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the "" movement "" which has apparently begun to grow .  pay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core .  it's as if director mimi leder didn't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't "" gutsy "" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for .  so the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being "" saved "" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather .  pay it forward offers "" crowd pleasing "" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking "" black hoodlum with a heart of gold "" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? .  hurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a "" nigga "" and says things like "" can you feel me ? ""  leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment .   ( maybe spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all ) .  these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings .  while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience .  it's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns .  one scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip .  spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance .  maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference .  the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender .  in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i'm not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol .  the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it's all very theatrical , especially hunt's performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar .  pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't get academy awards .  the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists .  even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections .  his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts : "" boy this outta floor em "" .  naturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher .  never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary .  nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics .  but oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life .  they're so adorable .  of course the blame can't all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row .  the first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth's possible demise by a crazed meteorite .  the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) .  deep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it's a movie that treats earth's impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days .  the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching .  in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : "" see my movie isn't as na ? ve as you might think "" she seems to be saying .  no , it's just horribly confused .

"tri-star ; rated r ( language , sexual situations , violence ) ; 87 minutes  director and writer : darren stein  cast : rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , judy greer , julie benz , chad christ , ethan erickson , carol kane , pam grier , tatyana m . ali .  review by : geoff berkshire  jawbreaker is the very definition of a "" rip-off . ""  this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s .  along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own .  the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her "" foxy "" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise .  liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind .  liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning .  in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her .  they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body ) .  courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her .  things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to .  in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students .  up until about this point the film is effective enough .  however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull .  the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch .  courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second .  meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot .  julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) .  he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid .  fern's rise to popularity is equally lame .  we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section .  it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him .  it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense .  stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting .  william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman .  at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer .  the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .  the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid .  they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color .  director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve's bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well .  shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive .  performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .  none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader .  the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like "" auto stud , "" "" college stud , "" and "" high school stud #2 . ""  the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen's catchy "" yoo hoo "" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film .  ",0
"fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade .  tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity .  most of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus .  those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends .  unfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal .  sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process .  on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself .  one of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 .  in the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence .  that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) .  unfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality .  death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out .  before the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) .  kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime .  bronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine .  although bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film .  the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade .  on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey .  unfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang .  the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget .  in short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia .   ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) .  ",0
"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is .  it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously .  mr . gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world .  and how does he show it ?  by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this .  oh , and it gets better .  a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) .  in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? ""  sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus .  of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) .   "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har ) .  it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! ""  - and by the way , do you get the symbolism ?  red , white , and blue ?  huh ?  huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them .  the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films .  gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide .  but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper .   "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level .  he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about .  here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff .  amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out .  she tells him to fuck off or something to that note .  he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly .  jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter .  the cash register rings up "" 6 . 66 ""   ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here ) .  jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car .  he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well .  the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money .  they say they don't have it .  he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) .  the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream .  i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out .  araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art .  wrong .  it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art .  when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick .  same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies .  it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled .  a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens .  here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances .  also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" ) .  people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line .  why are they here ?  so that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) !  wow ! ""  gimme a break .  the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence .  otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you .  look , i'm 19 years old .  i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did .  i've since moved on to "" i don't really know what to do with my life "" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse .  part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters .  it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent .  this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them .  it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's !  what they really need is a reality check .  the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting .  but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it .  the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it .  hence the title .  not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner .  everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex .  how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ?  how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ?  and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ?  if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are .  and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world .  and if you still don't think that "" the doom generation "" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting .  rose macgowan is horrible .  yes , she proved herself talented in "" scream , "" but she's so bad in "" the doom generation "" that if i had not seen her in "" scream , "" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today .  her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable .  equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain .  his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in "" that thing you do ! ""  and then there's james duval .  let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando .  he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him "" least talented actor in the world . ""  i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst .  or at least somewhere up there .  here's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , "" heresy "" ( example of the lines : "" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there "" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent .  the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says "" fuck . ""  no explanation of this should be necessary .  and finally , a note to gregg : grow up .  really .  move out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job .  and don't quit it .

"in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner .  his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake .  the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes .  hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts .  whichever one you like , dear , he says .  and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries .  i liked that scene for two reasons .  first , the cakes looked really cool .  second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act .  meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot .  it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .  the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .  i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy .  case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie .  however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani .   ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )  it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt .  and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished .  well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous .  so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately .  anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role .  the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .  if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society .  it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently .  he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) .  he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois .  he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .  and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there .  it's as if someone told pitt , "" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . ""  it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie .  i've used the phrase "" angel of death "" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels .  where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows .  where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant .  cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks .  the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .  he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood .   ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . )  hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .  of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder .  but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .  hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .  fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure .  i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why .  movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now .  go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .  don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .  -- curtis edmonds   "" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

"the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story .  the "" hook "" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic .  however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device .  those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed .  mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism .  the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow .  i don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible .  once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect .  while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense .  the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure .  unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death .  the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player .  soon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them .  along the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) .  why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ?  apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called "" mercury . ""  to make sure it can't be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a "" nerds' puzzle magazine . ""  of course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is .  when he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa .  as a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course .  but he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has .  it's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly .  for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren't that pulse-pounding .  the climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness .  overall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn't derivative or obligatory .  bruce willis' star seems to be fading .  this is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal .  willis isn't terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does .  alec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace .  the film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger .  mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers .  for those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year .  hopefully , the advent of summer will change that .  until then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video .  and , if you're determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may .
